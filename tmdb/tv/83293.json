Donna lost about 70 per cent of her sight after a heart attack, which has left her with severe tunnel vision aggravated by low lighting conditions in their dark cramped house, while their lumpy featureless yard offers little respite. Alan and his team - architect Helen Sisley, builder Kunle Barker and gardener Katie Rushworth - transform the family's indoor and outdoor spaces into bright usable spaces, with astounding results.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":83293,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2017-09-06","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1599540,"name":"Eltham","overview":"In episode two, Alan travels to Eltham, South London to meet Manisha and Rajeev Seesurrun. Their son Aryan was born in 2007 and almost immediately, his health became a huge concern. Aryan was starved of oxygen at birth and has been left with severe cerebral palsy as a result. He requires 24 hour care, so Manisha has given up her job and her dreams of becoming a designer to care for him full time, while Rajeev works long hours to support the family.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":83293,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2017-09-13","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"finale","id":1599541,"name":"Chester","overview":"This week Alan Titchmarsh is in Chester transforming not just the garden but the house too â€“ for retired couple Richard and Ann Price.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":83293,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":111214,"poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},"2":{"_id":"5bcb949d0e0a2627be0055e1","air_date":"2018-10-09","episodes":[{"air_date":"2018-10-09","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1599542,"name":"Benita and Josh","overview":"Alan Titchmarsh and a team of architects, builders and gardeners transform the kitchen and garden of wheelchair-bound 15-year-old Josh, who has multiple disabilities. The kitchen is so tiny that Josh and his mum Benita cannot be in it together, and Josh's wheelchair won't fit through the back door so the garden is completely off-limits. Architects Ewald and George create a new layout in the house so Josh can move from the front door to the back garden with ease, and task builder Kunle turns the kitchen into a state-of-the-art conservatory so mother and son can cook together for the first time. In the garden, Alan creates a series of different rooms, each designed to appeal to different senses.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":2,"show_id":83293,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-10-16","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1599543,"name":"The Taylor Family","overview":"Alan Titchmarsh and his team of experts meet Anne and Mike, who have been married for 54 years and for almost a decade have been dealing with Mike's dementia.

An even bigger challenge is the garden, which is more than a metre below the house and therefore off-limits to Mike.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":2,"show_id":83293,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-01-15","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"finale","id":4105131,"name":"Swindon","overview":"Alan Titchmarsh and his team bring the outside indoors for an inspirational family in Swindon.
