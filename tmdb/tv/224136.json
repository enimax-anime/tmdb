The gleaming yacht sound was, in part, always defined by a group of LA-based session players and composers who worked across a range of yacht bands, informing their specific tone and level of musicianship.  Some of these artists talk about the yacht phenomenon and being part of the scene back in the day. The series explores how the music adapted from the the bearded sensitivity of the '70s to the bombast of the MTV '80s, and how a satirical online drama contributed to a revival of interest and enthusiasm for these sounds in the digital era.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/aiIB5ni40rL0PHb7s2cbElUcgeJ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":30249,"logo_path":"/nHNMrZ0I1ybL1jzEbNPTZZkyLE2.png","name":"IWC Media","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2019-06-14","episode_count":2,"id":336331,"name":"Miniseries","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"6430c91631032500772817ad","air_date":"2019-06-14","episodes":[{"air_date":"2019-06-14","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":4351022,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"Katie Puckrik begins a voyage through a halcyon period of Los Angeles studio craft when studio-based artists like The Doobie Brothers, Steely Dan and Hall & Oates produced the smoothest R&B and married it to adult themes about longing, aspiration and melancholy.","production_code":"","runtime":59,"season_number":1,"show_id":224136,"still_path":"/z4KBCfBMtH1wvjbbpLgz2n3QQJv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-06-21","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"finale","id":4351231,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"Katie charts the progress of yacht rock through the 1980s, when it became the soundtrack to America in the Reagan era, and when artists like Toto, Hall & Oates and George Benson created a technicolor second wave of a super smooth sound.","production_code":"","runtime":58,"season_number":1,"show_id":224136,"still_path":"/inQkvOldDwSLHRzr3E4EXoFoVY0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Miniseries","overview":"","id":336331,"poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
