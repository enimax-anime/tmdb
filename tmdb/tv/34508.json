The show was cancelled after one season. The concept of the show was that three stand-up comedians per episode perform their acts in front of an audience, with Benson sitting on a throne by the side of the stage. When the time to present a humorous punch-line approaches, Benson interrupted the comic with a comment with the intent of adding to the humor of the joke.\n\nThe first season aired on Fridays at midnight on Comedy Central.","popularity":2.443,"poster_path":"/nojBfJT5RgvRwcqE2bYNwAAdFnp.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2010-11-06","episode_count":6,"id":45259,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258d8c0760ee3466171c872","air_date":"2010-11-06","episodes":[{"air_date":"2010-11-06","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":787345,"name":"Nick Swardson, Nick Kroll and Chris Hardwick","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":34508,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"5258d8c0760ee3466171c89b","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27738,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Hardwick","original_name":"Chris Hardwick","popularity":1.96,"profile_path":"/dKCyapNYbzeihK38YHJoEzpSUw1.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"5258d8c0760ee3466171c8a9","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":32907,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nick Swardson","original_name":"Nick Swardson","popularity":19.506,"profile_path":"/mkI0t4n0kV3tulTG41syiXGTmZk.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"5258d8c0760ee3466171c8b7","order":504,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":208519,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nick Kroll","original_name":"Nick Kroll","popularity":13.547,"profile_path":"/fNiOuEKeBtELGdhKn4lxXq4O7YP.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2010-11-13","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":787346,"name":"Eugene Mirman, Rob Huebel and Mary Lynn Rajskub","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":34508,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"5258d8c0760ee3466171c8d6","order":501,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25884,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Lynn Rajskub","original_name":"Mary Lynn Rajskub","popularity":19.623,"profile_path":"/rJxAkgYX3RfY9x2aYo2InbEp1HL.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"5258d8c0760ee3466171c8e4","order":503,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1217563,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eugene Mirman","original_name":"Eugene Mirman","popularity":5.283,"profile_path":"/7ua1lNOWxMOK8m7amVsvIatQ6G2.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2010-11-20","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":787344,"name":"Todd Barry, The Sklar Brothers and Paul Scheer","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":34508,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-12-04","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":787347,"name":"Thomas Lennon, Michael Ian Black and Andrew Daly","overview":"Benson interrupts his friends Tom Lennon, Michael Ian Black and Andy Daly as they do their sets.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":34508,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-12-10","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":787348,"name":"Brian Posehn, Greg Proops and Tig Notaro","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":34508,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-12-17","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"finale","id":787349,"name":"TJ Miller, Adam Carolla and Graham Elwood","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":34508,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":45259,"poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
