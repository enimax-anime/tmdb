However, the format was only released in full screen instead of wide screen. In the UK, History Channel released the third and final season on DVD however, the episodes were released in the incorrect airdate order.","popularity":3.027,"poster_path":"/6E8GPTWAiZN0eKOeJkE4iLWQAFi.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":2,"id":28537,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2008-01-30","episode_count":13,"id":28536,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/8SMqOll6GQKxWxwsCXDU9j4jzyP.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":10},{"air_date":"2008-10-29","episode_count":13,"id":28538,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/v77enbEksfkc2FmUia5uXCD2xUR.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2009-03-19","episode_count":13,"id":28539,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/zeBqZXf3LrKR6ayY3eifdbQQSEF.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6,"vote_count":10,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525852d2760ee34661070930","air_date":"2008-01-30","episodes":[{"air_date":"2008-01-30","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":557792,"name":"The UFO Before Roswell","overview":"Six unidentified objects were seen near Maury Island, Washington; two Air Force officers later came to the site, investigated, and collected evidence.

The objects appeared on radar at Edwards and were also picked up on radar at San Pedro, LAADS, George AFB and were seen visually at George and several areas at Edwards.\n\nThe team interviews Sgt. Sorrels, listens to the audio of the events as they happened and plot the radar and visual sightings.
