It was aired on MTV in 2002 until 2003.\n\nSnoop Dogg stated that according to the contract, the show was to air six times, but it turned out to be a series of eight parts. The second season was canceled due to payment negotiation issues, since Snoop Dogg asked for $1 million for his role, which MTV refused to pay him.\n\nIn the beginning of every show Snoop is seen sitting bored in a leather armchair in an empty room while switching channels from Jerry Springer to a cart race then to black and white burlesque figure skating after that to a strip show and finally to a Richard Marx music video when he decides to change the situation and the idea of Doggy Fizzle Televizzle comes to his mind. This ends the intro and the main theme follows with Snoop rapping.","popularity":1.612,"poster_path":"/wD0ZeAjyLj3Yhl91HArd41bixXP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6043,"logo_path":null,"name":"MTV Networks","origin_country":""},{"id":20112,"logo_path":"/3N6td1WWMtX7BPj5ja2U2mLJUQT.png","name":"PFFR","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2002-11-25","episode_count":8,"id":5976,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52571ec6760ee3776a1dd54d","air_date":"2002-11-25","episodes":[{"air_date":"2002-11-25","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":137559,"name":"The Race Card","overview":"Snoop plays Mr. Dizzle, a substitute elementary school teacher who taught the kids bad things.
