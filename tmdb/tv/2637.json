Nadia makes it clear from the outset that she is going to be quick with the criticisms and is less than impressed with some of Sophie's dopey comments (she asks if potatoes grow on trees) or Brian's uncouth behaviour.\n\nOn night two Nadia is convinced that she's going to win with her authentic Portuguese menu. It's not long before conversation turns to this week's hot topic - breasts - and an eye-watering anecdote from Nadia leaves everyone shocked.\n\nBrian Belo plays host on night three and there are farcical scenes as the novice chef attempts to prep his ambitious menu, and yet more flirting between Brian Belo and Sophie, culminating in a cheeky kiss.\n\nOn the final night 'stranger to vegetables' Sophie hosts, with a minimal menu and an even more minimal outfit. At the table, Sophie shows her latest bikini photos to the group, much to Brian Belo's delight. The dinner ends on a sour note, however, when Nadia vents her spleen at a shell-shocked Brian Belo.\n\nBut which of the popular Big Brother winners will be crowned the Champion of Champions and win the Â£1,000 charity prize?",
