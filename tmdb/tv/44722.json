His opponent is a man who was born into a fishing dynasty and caught his first cod at the ripe old age of seven. The man who pulls in the most cod wins the day. Next, Robson travels to the frozen wastelands of the highlands to join a group of ice fishermen. His opponent for the day is a retired professional opera singer, who uses every trick in his song book to put Robson off his game. The target is Arctic char and the angler who lands the heaviest combined weight is the winner. Victory is traditionally washed down with a shot of Icelandic hooch. Robson then takes on a Viking blacksmith with a terrifyingly long cast. Perched on the rugged cliffs over Eyja Fjord they cast into the icy sea for dab and cod. The further they cast, the better the chance of catching.",

New Zealand is one of the most hostile sporting environments on earth, and Robson knows that he is in for a battle. His first challenge takes him to the waters off the port of Nelson on the north coast of New Zealand's South Island. After being dropped in by helicopter, he faces an extreme challenge that requires an extreme form of angler, such as his opponent. Toby Reid is a man who specialises in fishing the places other fishermen cannot reach. The target for the day is the New Zealand Blue Cod, a sports fish Robson has never caught before. Robson then heads for the mouth of the Hurunui River on the South Island's east coast, where he goes after Kawahai or the Salmon of the Sea.",

When Robson first visited in 2000, his passion for extreme fishing took off. Over a decade later, he returns to prove himself by taking on the very man who first taught him to deep sea fish. His opening challenge takes him to the dazzling lagoons in the south east of the island. His opponent for the day, Dominique Thevanau (aka The Dominator) is a fishing veteran whose extreme speciality is taking a fly rod into the surf that breaks on the edges of the lagoons. The pair target the huge shoals of giant trevally feeding on the reefs, with the person who catches the most fish winning. But it seems that Robson is catching more surf than fish. For his next challenge, he heads inland to the island’s fertile interior in search of one of the best kept angling secrets in Mauritius. Among the thousands of cane fields lies a little-known lake that is a bass fishing haven.",
