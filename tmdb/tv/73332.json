But then in May 2002, someone claiming to be the killer sends the police a letter along with a map printed from a computer-mapping site. The map leads police to the remains of another body. What the killer doesn't realise is that he has unwittingly led the investigators right to his door. Police are able to trace the making of the map to a computer belonging to a Maury Troy Travis, a 36-year-old waiter born and raised in St. Louis. When police descend on his home, they uncover the true horror of Travis' crimes: a torture dungeon where he filmed his horrific abuse and even some of the murders of his victims.

A truck driver and son of a bingo-addicted, alcoholic mother and compulsive gambling father, he was incarcerated in juvenile detention at a young age where he suffered his first rape. On his release he began molesting young boys - a crime that would see him imprisoned and consigned to a mental institution. He met a part-time magician, Vernon Butts, and struck up a deadly friendship that would see them recruit a small gang of accomplices and go on to rape and murder lone boys, often hitch-hiking in the southern Californian sunshine. His victims were attacked in the back of his van, named by investigators as \"the Death Wagon\" and dumped by the side of the freeway, earning him the title; \"The Freeway Killer\".","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":2,"show_id":73332,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-05-20","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"finale","id":1942255,"name":"The Scorecard Killer","overview":"When police see a car weaving between lanes on a Californian highway late one night, they pull the car over.

A former military airman, Kraft targeted marines and gay men, routinely sodomising and emasculating them before he killed them. The torture his victims endured became more and more extreme. A computer programmer with a high IQ, Kraft to this day maintains his innocence and despite the extensive evidence against him, denies killing anyone. He is currently appealing his death sentence in the Federal courts. Kraft now sits on Death Row in the infamous San Quentin prison, convicted of 16 counts of murder. Known as the \"Scorecard Killer\" because of a piece of paper he kept believed to be a death list of victims, conservative estimates allege he has killed at least 50 more. Others put his total body count at over 100.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":2,"show_id":73332,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Series 2","overview":"The unfortunate truth of modern policing is that despite all the DNA tests, criminal profiles and surveillance technology it's still extremely difficult to catch a killer.
