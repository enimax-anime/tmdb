Missy's actions are claimed \"accidental\", however Sam realizes what Missy is trying to do, but no one believes her as they think Sam is being \"her usual paranoid self\", because she was being paranoid when she thought Lewbert was an undercover cop, because she thought his giant wart was a spy cam and thought Gibby was a mermaid because he doesn't like wearing shirts. Missy confesses to Sam, but since no one will believe her, she is forced to ask Freddie for help, so when Freddie wins a six month cruise, he gives it to Missy so she will go away. Shortly after Missy is awarded with the cruise, Carly discovers Missy's plans to destroy her and Sam's friendship. Meanwhile, while packing for a camping trip, Spencer is locked in the basement by a psychotic boy, Chuck, seeking revenge from Spencer for telling on him and getting him grounded in the episode \"iHurt Lewbert\".

When the iCarly gang wins, Ricky is crushed, and quits cooking forever. The iCarly gang try to cheer him up by tempting him with cooking, but his head falls in the salad. Later, he sends them a video, telling them to meet him at the wrestling ring. When they get there, Ricky is wrestling little kids because he figured out that he doesn't like to cook, but he likes to win, and when he's fighting kids, there's no way he can lose. Then Sam brings him down, and the show ends. Meanwhile, Spencer has a vision of the future, that he will hug a character from Galaxy Wars when he is shocked by Sam's new 100 volt locker security system and goes to great measures to make sure it comes true.","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":3,"show_id":5371,"still_path":"/tydqfZu6NU1nez5dyfSMKYiCcAo.jpg","vote_average":9,"vote_count":2,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257807e760ee36aaa5e6fe9","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70804,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Dan
