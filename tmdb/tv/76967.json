She runs away on a cargo train to Rio de Janeiro, where later she takes shelter with a loving family in Rio's suburbs.

Conceição becomes a brazilian funk star, but she doesn't loose her pure nature, reassuring her integrity before the obstacles of life. These common people face a recurring dilemma to all of us: How to maintain your notion of justice, ethics and morals, in times of violence, inequity and decadence of values?","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/jOCRwzPVPlDeyZCXsU0pwR5iI14.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":46430,"logo_path":"/tQZIt59BLw3b0b6rHJRqv4Dvrpd.png","name":"Estúdios Globo","origin_country":"BR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BR","name":"Brazil"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2012-11-01","episode_count":8,"id":99077,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/kc0MkSqu0bNgRKMq2rOUcFUOwdC.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Portuguese","iso_639_1":"pt","name":"Português"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5a7e35bec3a3681895000273","air_date":"2012-11-01","episodes":[{"air_date":"2012-11-01","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1430794,"name":"Eposode 1","overview":"Conceicao loses her brother and goes to Rio de Janeiro to try a new life.","production_code":"","runtime":40,"season_number":1,"show_id":76967,"still_path":"/uVVh26xpLSjGiA002oQiCzZ4Qxi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-11-08","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1430795,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"Conceicao and Cleiton start a romance.","production_code":"","runtime":40,"season_number":1,"show_id":76967,"still_path":"/yhITt6aRMUi6ycyRhEkYMlWlJLi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-11-15","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1430796,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"Conceicao wins first place in the baile funk of Madureira, begins to study with Cleiton and starts to work on a gas station.","production_code":"","runtime":40,"season_number":1,"show_id":76967,"still_path":"/9kSb63oL4OLVHODFrMskJq3ApWj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-11-22","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":1430797,"name":"Episode 4","overview":"Conceicao is named Suburbia in the baile funk of Madureira.
