However, during the transaction, they are interrupted by a KGB agent, Col. Parlovsky who shoots & kills the Russian, then runs off as FBI agents show up, finding Harm over the body, with the gun & documents he wrestled away.\n\nAs the FBI wants to hold him for the murder of the Russian, Adm. Chegwiggen manages to have Harm transferred to a military brig, and court-martialed, much to the dismay of the FBI agents.  CIA agent Clayton Webb, knowing that it was Parlovsky, not Harm that committed the shooting, arranges for Harm to escape from custody in hopes Parlovsky will contact Harm.\n\nIn the end, Parlovsky makes contact with Harm, but they both get away before Webb can catch them.  Parlovsky tells Harm the documents were a fake and burns them.  He then leaves, refusing to help clear Harm of the shooting.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":3,"show_id":4376,"still_path":"/oNbPH7cq3O5lbvvtEjFtdU5n9jd.jpg","vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257660c760ee36aaa371e1b","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1221117,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Larry Moskowitz","original_name":"Larry Moskowitz","popularity":1.38,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52576620760ee36aaa37494b","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":17309,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Greg Beeman","original_name":"Greg Beeman","popularity":4.026,"profile_path":"/eMZIGB6jbIldPK4YyZ44uf7ZIGg.jpg"},{"job":"Stunt Coordinator","department":"Crew","credit_id":"5dce5a2cb76cbb0013765ff9","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16575,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Diamond Farnsworth","original_name":"Diamond Farnsworth","popularity":2.048,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","credit_id":"5dce512579a1c300134917d7","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1828228,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Larry Lindsey","original_name":"Larry Lindsey","popularity":2.089,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"5dd3a3c957d37806f5d6a82f","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1665713,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Randy D.

Webb mentions that one of them, Victor Lushov is now working in San Diego.  Harm requests from the Admiral to take an F-14 hop to San Diego to visit his mother, keeping secret his true intentions.\n\nIn San Diego, Harm meets with Lushov who turns out to be a Russian pilot who was instrumental interoggating Harm, Sr. after he was shot down over Vietnam, later befriending him.  He tells Harm Jr. all about what happened to his father, that Harm Sr. fed all kinds of disinformation to the Russians, which was worse than telling them nothing.  Lushov gives Harm Jr. the KGB file number for his father.  And says he wants to live and will not repeat what he has said to anyone.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":3,"show_id":4376,"still_path":"/kRIqZAJCJ2oSFjWesWAnhAasPl8.jpg","vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257660c760ee36aaa371c0f","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219869,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Wharmby","original_name":"Tony Wharmby","popularity":2.041,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257661f760ee36aaa3746b7","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160145,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Donald P.

The rape victim, Petty Officer Lopez, tells Mac that, after an evening of drinking with her three male shipmates, she found herself alone at the bar where they ditched her as part of an initiation into their team. The next morning when she awakened in her car, she realized that she had been raped. When the shipmates heard Lopez's story, they exacted revenge on the man they thought attacked her -- the bar owner.

She is acquitted, thanks to fancy legal-speak from Harm - although she does not have to face a court-martial, she does end being sent up on an Admiral's Mast, which just might be worse.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":4,"show_id":4376,"still_path":"/xlzVdmBHsoaGtAdnB8MsRLI74jG.jpg","vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257660c760ee36aaa371cc3","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1181325,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Zabel","original_name":"David Zabel","popularity":1.242,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Stunt Coordinator","department":"Crew","credit_id":"5dce5a2cb76cbb0013765ff9","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16575,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Diamond Farnsworth","original_name":"Diamond Farnsworth","popularity":2.048,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","credit_id":"5e31732f98f1f10012ff3de6","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1456108,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Bing Sokolsky","original_name":"Bing Sokolsky","popularity":1.116,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5e4669c70c2710001a8784ce","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1546877,"known_for_department":"Lighting","name":"Hugo Cortina","original_name":"Hugo Cortina","popularity":1.127,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Mike Roberts","credit_id":"5395cd9a0e0a266dbf006d3e","order":4,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":231445,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Bellisario","original_name":"Michael Bellisario","popularity":4.724,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Mary Hanratti","credit_id":"5257660e760ee36aaa3723be","order":581,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":19434,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sharon Farrell","original_name":"Sharon Farrell","popularity":10.07,"profile_path":"/mM8JYH9KJXi5fvBZoHsYJ1WrlgP.jpg"},{"character":"Peter Reardon","credit_id":"5257660f760ee36aaa3723f4","order":656,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67524,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leo Rossi","original_name":"Leo Rossi","popularity":5.98,"profile_path":"/uHhTdiRzS3dZWGZFoQiMyfQqEVt.jpg"},{"character":"Seaman Hendrix","credit_id":"5257660f760ee36aaa37242a","order":743,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151377,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anthony Montgomery","original_name":"Anthony Montgomery","popularity":5.243,"profile_path":"/56nYKjXlm8lii2HvS3x5xePye8o.jpg"},{"character":"Lopez","credit_id":"5e466a4541465c0018d4f54c","order":1463,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":144975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mercedes Colon","original_name":"Mercedes Colon","popularity":5.615,"profile_path":"/wOIxl1DMc2b3i2GwX3wz968uAaM.jpg"},{"character":"Colbert","credit_id":"5e466a869603310015f6ed80","order":1464,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105270,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Schanley","original_name":"Tom Schanley","popularity":3.928,"profile_path":"/qvbEZGElemAxcPK0rqmTH8cmnbK.jpg"},{"character":"Captain Kilmer","credit_id":"5e466b219603310017f67f7b","order":1465,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2538174,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Hutter","original_name":"Mark Hutter","popularity":0.996,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Alan Mattoni","credit_id":"52576617760ee36aaa37354b","order":1466,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15373,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rif Hutton","original_name":"Rif Hutton","popularity":1.55,"profile_path":"/1RqWCEgCr3K47QxKoWiPEoT8pBZ.jpg"},{"character":"Stiles Morris","credit_id":"52576615760ee36aaa373294","order":1798,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":45101,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harrison Page","original_name":"Harrison Page","popularity":10.139,"profile_path":"/uqoZdiO6ar3hVeX09u9JARVvfkA.jpg"},{"character":"Mic Brumby","credit_id":"5257660c760ee36aaa371d77","order":1890,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":57252,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Trevor Goddard","original_name":"Trevor Goddard","popularity":9.479,"profile_path":"/hQvYSwjP8beKIKyAf2N5OlPkW7Q.jpg"},{"character":"Jason Tiner","credit_id":"5dfa65796097500012331a05","order":1907,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86936,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chuck Carrington","original_name":"Chuck Carrington","popularity":5.172,"profile_path":"/x9BSj1vL6RUHaNUYsiOeDR6RpNR.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1999-01-13","episode_number":13,"episode_type":"standard","id":302608,"name":"War Stories (2)","overview":"When three U.N. peacekeepers are taken hostage in Kosovo, a SEAL team is sent in to rescue them before the end of a 24-hour deadline set by the terrorists.

However, Mac is trying to cope with her conflicting emotions for both Harm & Mic. On the edge of going unconscious from severe hypothermia, Harm's fires several warning shots which attracts the rescue helicopter. Back onboard the USS Patrick Henry, Harm's vital signs start to fade out, but Skates words help him pull through. Transferred to Bethesda Hospital, Renee learns that Harm has partial amnesia and doesn't remember them being a couple over the past year. Mac's indecision about the wedding drives Brumby back to Australia. When Harm tells Mac on the phone to come to his place so that she doesn't have to be alone, she arrives only to learn that Renee has beaten her to Harm's place with the news that her father has died.
