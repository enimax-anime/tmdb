The Little Princess","overview":"A King and a town loved their little Princess until one day she grew too big, so the King made everything big to accommodate her, but he ran out of money. To raise money, he enforced a tax law on everything, and the town became rebellious, so the King asks his board what to do, and they suggested to marry her off, suiters arrived but when they say her they ran, and she cried and started to flood the crops, so the King sent her on daily walks. On a walk, she meet a funny little man and kissed him hoping he'd become a prince, but instead she shrunk back down to her normal size, and all was well in the kingdom, except that tax law was still in order.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":1025,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1961-05-13","episode_number":238,"episode_type":"standard","id":1024909,"name":"Bullwinkle's Corner -
