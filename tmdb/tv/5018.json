EPISODE #111","overview":"A classic episode as far as football fans are concerned.  Not only was Frank a great guest on this episode but his New York Giants teammate Alex Webster was a contestant in the second round.  Teamed with Betsy Palmer, Alex didn't get one word correct and lost 0-25.  In fact it took them four clues to get \"\"Quarterback\"\"!  Frank's teammate didn't know anything about football and after Betsy gave Alex the first clue \"\"Halfback\"\", Alex guessed \"\"Fullback\"\".  Then Frank gave his teammate \"\"Tittle\"\".  She guessed \"\"Fullback\"\".  As everyone anticipated an easy Webster victory, Betsy gave the clue \"\"Y.A.\"\", which is two words!  How embarrasing!  Frank then says \"\"Lesser\"\" and his teammate says \"\"Quarterback\"\".  That 7 points wins the game and after Frank and his teammate win $250 in the lightning round, Betsy apologizes and says \"\"I'll pay him\"\".  Truly a classic segment.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":3,"show_id":5018,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-03-26","episode_number":27,"episode_type":"standard","id":347869,"name":"(PT) EPISODE #112","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":3,"show_id":5018,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-04-02","episode_number":28,"episode_type":"standard","id":347868,"name":"(PT) EPISODE #113","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":3,"show_id":5018,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-04-09","episode_number":29,"episode_type":"standard","id":347862,"name":"(PT) EPISODE #114","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":3,"show_id":5018,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-04-16","episode_number":30,"episode_type":"standard","id":347864,"name":"(PT) EPISODE #115","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":3,"show_id":5018,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-04-23","episode_number":31,"episode_type":"standard","id":347870,"name":"(PT) EPISODE #116","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":3,"show_id":5018,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-04-30","episode_number":32,"episode_type":"standard","id":347865,"name":"(PT) EPISODE #117","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":3,"show_id":5018,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-05-07","episode_number":33,"episode_type":"standard","id":347873,"name":"(PT) EPISODE #118","overview":"Lucy and Gary were joined on the show by her children, Desi Jr. (age 11) and Lucie (\"\"13 in July\"\").
