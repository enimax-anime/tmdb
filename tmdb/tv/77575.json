She meets the scientists pushing temperature to the very limits of cold, where the normal laws of physics break down and a new world of scientific possibility begins. The extraordinary behaviour of matter at temperatures close to absolute zero is driving the advance of technology, from superconductors to quantum computing.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":77575,"still_path":"/mIxsnbzYkoxFANwrl4rJEBTRz14.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-02-22","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1445586,"name":"A Temperature for Life","overview":"Physicist Dr Helen Czerski explores the narrow band of temperature that has led to life on Earth. She reveals how life began in a dramatic place where hot meets cold, and how every single living creature on Earth depends on temperature for its survival. She uncovers the extraordinary natural engineering that animals have evolved to keep their bodies at the right temperature. And she witnesses the remarkable surgery that's using temperature to push the human body to the very brink of life.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":77575,"still_path":"/2G07s9s05dIouuxOTmRxBl5lSQM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-03-01","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"finale","id":1445587,"name":"Playing with Fire","overview":"Dr Helen Czerksi explores the extraordinary science of heat.
