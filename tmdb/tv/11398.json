It ran for 23 episodes, not including the two-hour pilot film originally titled Probe. When picked up for series production, the title had to be changed because Probe was the name of an existing PBS series. In the UK the series aired on BBC 1 under the title Search Control.\n\nThe show was created by Leslie Stevens, and produced by Leslie Stevens, Robert Justman, John Strong and Tony Spinner. The high concept was described as \"science fiction in today's world\" and the episodes featured many high-tech elements which are considered common in current science fiction shows.","popularity":9.233,"poster_path":"/rg0CMU0109heOKwWYVzIW94P963.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1957,"logo_path":"/pJJw98MtNFC9cHn3o15G7vaUnnX.png","name":"Warner Bros.
