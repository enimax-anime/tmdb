Back at the house, Whitney creates a phone list which is a schedule that assigns each girl a limited amount of time to call home. When Dominique misses her phone time, she causes a row with Whitney, escalating to the point where Dominique accuses Whitney of being a racist, of which the latter denies.\n\nFor their challenge, Benny and Vendela test their knowledge of the three types of poses by pitting them against each other in a posing challenge. Team B, consisting of Claire, Katarzyna, Marvita, Stacy Ann and Whitney, ultimately wins a trip to a swag tent. Claire is deemed the best overall and wins an additional prize - a trip to Bora Bora.\n\nThe week's photo shoot required the girls to do an extreme beauty shot with paint as their main makeup. Most girls deliver once again but Fatima, Marvita and Whitney all struggle with their shoots.\n\nAt panel, most of the girls are praised for strong shots, especially Stacy Ann's, but Marvita and Whitney's pictures are deemed unsatisfactory.

But her mom convinces her that she is better than them and Dominique believes her and tries to ignore them.\n\nTyra teaches the girls how to pose at the end of the runway and how to pose while looking pained. She then declares a pose-off, in which Anya impresses Tyra the most. The teach was actually a secret challenge, and Anya wins a chance to shoot timeless nude photographs taken by Nigel Barker.\n\nWhitney is commended for her photo, while Fatima is finally given approval for her range of poses.

The models walk for three designers, where they all receive rather positive reviews but the designers criticize Lauren's walk. There is concern that Whitney and Dominique's dislike of each other would impede their team's progress, but their team nevertheless wins the challenge, with Stacy Ann receiving the most bookings in the winning team. The entire team wins a shoot for the June issue of Seventeen magazine.\n\nAt the photo shoot, the girls have to pose over a mylar sheet in water from the off-Broadway show Fuerzabruta. Claire hurts her neck after falling straight down on the sheet, causing her to struggle with her shoot.

Anya's commercial is described as a \"trainwreck\", but that is overlooked by her personality on film and her stellar look in the commercial. However, her beauty shot, as portrayed by Paulina, came off as her looking \"stupid\".\n\nAnya was called first for her personality in her commercial, leaving Fatima and Whitney in the bottom two, both for the fourth time.
