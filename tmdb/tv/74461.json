But following a crackdown on their over-prescription, where does this leave the two million Americans who have developed a habit for these high-strength painkillers?\n\nWith the pills now becoming increasingly expensive and scarce on the black market, vast numbers of Americans have turned to the cheaper and stronger opiate: heroin. The drug now claims more lives in the US than either car accidents or gun crime. And, for the first time in over two decades, life expectancy in the US is declining - largely attributed to the rise in fatal heroin overdoses.\n\nIn Huntington, West Virginia, Louis Theroux embeds himself in an Appalachian community that is being devastated and stretched to its limits by widespread heroin use. With one in ten babies in the city born dependent on opiates and a fatal overdose rate 13 times the national average, this is the epicentre of the most deadly drug epidemic in US history.\n\nLouis spends time with the user community caught in the vice-like grip of drug misuse and follows the emergency services struggling to cope with multiple overdoses each day.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":74461,"still_path":"/4kczwcGnHBqO4cq1KbTHPu99pwJ.jpg","vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"crew":[{"job":"Editorial Staff","department":"Crew","credit_id":"59dcde66c3a36861ec07705f","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469338,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mike Curd","original_name":"Mike Curd","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Production Manager","department":"Production","credit_id":"59dcddd0c3a368620d06a15d","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1242171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephanie Edwards","original_name":"Stephanie Edwards","popularity":1.22,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Sound Recordist","department":"Sound","credit_id":"59dcdd3592514124cd07850c","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1619726,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Freddie Claire","original_name":"Freddie Claire","popularity":1.094,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Production Coordinator","department":"Production","credit_id":"59dcddafc3a368623e075045","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1903638,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Tanya Severn","original_name":"Tanya Severn","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Original Music Composer","department":"Sound","credit_id":"59dcdccb92514124c5078202","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1903634,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Danny Farrant","original_name":"Danny Farrant","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Visual Effects","department":"Visual Effects","credit_id":"59dcdd8cc3a36861a3075ade","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1903637,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Andy A'Court","original_name":"Andy A'Court","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Production Manager","department":"Production","credit_id":"59dcddebc3a36861a3075b54","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1903639,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Theresa Lydon","original_name":"Theresa Lydon","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Sound","department":"Sound","credit_id":"59dcde4a925141251f0797a2","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1469337,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Danny Finn","original_name":"Danny Finn","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Presenter","department":"Crew","credit_id":"59dcdcb29251412514079ca4","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":219396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Theroux","original_name":"Louis Theroux","popularity":6.212,"profile_path":"/bd1aUigEuidrND9C1vumCN3pC0o.jpg"},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"59dcdc58925141252c0751ff","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1728247,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Peter Dale","original_name":"Peter Dale","popularity":2.241,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Original Music Composer","department":"Sound","credit_id":"59dcdceb925141251f0795f6","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1903635,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Nick Kingsley","original_name":"Nick Kingsley","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/q00HRFQIH4l30xrW4eNCW5shzEB.jpg"},{"job":"Production Manager","department":"Production","credit_id":"59dcde2ac3a36862270718ef","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1902407,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Danny Yasruddin","original_name":"Danny Yasruddin","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"59dcdc44c3a368624d073a20","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1045274,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Dan Child","original_name":"Dan Child","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"59dcdc7592514124cd078446","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1434479,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Anna Price","original_name":"Anna Price","popularity":0.607,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"59dcdca2925141252c075261","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":219396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Theroux","original_name":"Louis Theroux","popularity":6.212,"profile_path":"/bd1aUigEuidrND9C1vumCN3pC0o.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2017-10-15","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1378568,"name":"Trafficking Sex","overview":"Houston, the fourth largest city in the US, is widely considered to be the number one hub for human trafficking in North America.

He discovers a subculture that plays by rules that are morally challenging to most people and seeks to understand what stops these women breaking free.
