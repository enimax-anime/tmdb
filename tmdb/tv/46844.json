So what’s the average working day for a hero? Make your keen young colleague deal with the boring paperwork? Wind up your fellow employees? Flirt with the new girl on the team? Or deal with an unseen enemy who’s trying to blow you up? Bluestone 42 is a comedy drama about a bunch of soldiers who just happen to be risking their lives diffusing hidden bombs. But who says they can’t have some fun alongside the serious professional stuff? This hilarious and often surprising series follows the adventures of a bunch of diverse characters living and working together at an army base in Afghanistan. This is a show about something easily forgotten; soldiers really enjoy being soldiers, but it’s not just a show for soldiers and it’s not just about the Army: it’s also a show for anybody who has ever fallen in love, experienced status battles at work or had a fear of failure. It is packed with the lively workmate banter and relationship minefields that most people will recognise. Even if they don’t face danger on a daily basis...","popularity":4.012,"poster_path":"/nxHMf7PnrVHv5y5GWHCJyN9zYWV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ZA","name":"South Africa"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2013-12-26","episode_count":1,"id":63304,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/1crScTCDrYlQjPltogJ7Nf9oVNd.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2013-03-05","episode_count":8,"id":55022,"name":"Series 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/yxFdX3j5v0xPFJsljjXk5aSw2LG.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":6},{"air_date":"2014-02-27","episode_count":6,"id":55023,"name":"Series 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/pPt7MxfOXIwxO27EvW0VIzzcnZR.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2015-03-09","episode_count":6,"id":62107,"name":"Series 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/aCe6fuzmtnF9cIwZqXyABt6Dex6.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.4,"vote_count":10,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525973b2760ee34661a56169","air_date":"2013-03-05","episodes":[{"air_date":"2013-03-05","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":913799,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"The team experience a tough roadside ops, whilst Mary grabs the attention of Nick.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":46844,"still_path":"/aawSEBLufmsiNodwkNPzEhJBEwJ.jpg","vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Patricia","credit_id":"5ed70e21a5046e0022fffd39","order":508,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1441679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ndoni Khanyile","original_name":"Ndoni Khanyile","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Carter","credit_id":"5ed70e370398ab0021d0f9a2","order":509,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael McShane","original_name":"Michael McShane","popularity":5.726,"profile_path":"/xGd7WMiumvnsGttbBXVRsrhos7X.jpg"},{"character":"Soldier","credit_id":"5ed70e771b157d001e5676c0","order":514,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2374091,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Spinas","original_name":"Chris Spinas","popularity":0.656,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Tim","credit_id":"5ed70e50a5046e0022fffd64","order":520,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1003249,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sven Ruygrok","original_name":"Sven Ruygrok","popularity":2.695,"profile_path":"/dUr3VBQQ5n2nHmxkpsOnvBPm9Ri.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2013-03-12","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":913800,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"Nick is desperate to find some decent food to use in an attempt to seduce Mary.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":46844,"still_path":"/eCgvRX58pJXnhKg0Nuha3LRbCfA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Soldier","credit_id":"5ed70e771b157d001e5676c0","order":514,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2374091,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Spinas","original_name":"Chris Spinas","popularity":0.656,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":"2013-03-19","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":913796,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"Bluestone 42 join a midnight raid on a bomb factory and rescue a kidnapped aid worker.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":46844,"still_path":"/swTXSThuF9NaC3MbLObgHa873Se.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Astrid","credit_id":"5ed70ee8fea0d7001f8b7ac4","order":510,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":90514,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Birgitte Hjort Sørensen","original_name":"Birgitte Hjort Sørensen","popularity":11.662,"profile_path":"/uPak0FlCPdsc9B1pw4bBkuaMLXT.jpg"},{"character":"Captain Softly","credit_id":"5ed70ef70398ab0022cfaa43","order":511,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1772680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Murray Todd","original_name":"Murray Todd","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Soldier","credit_id":"5ed70e771b157d001e5676c0","order":514,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2374091,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Chris Spinas","original_name":"Chris Spinas","popularity":0.656,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":"2013-03-26","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":913797,"name":"Episode 4","overview":"Mary reveals a secret about her past.
