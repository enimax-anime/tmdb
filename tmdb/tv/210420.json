After meeting in their hometown of Portland, Oregon, Jinkx & Liam quickly found they shared a twisted sense of humor and started writing sketches together in quarantine. This 8-episode series is born out of their weirdest ideas, featuring celebrity impersonations, a revival of Jinkx's first Snatch Game character Little Edie, and hilarious (and humiliating) new material from this duo’s wacky minds. Filmed in Portland and Los Angeles, the series includes celebrity guests like Trixie Mattel, Brittany Broski and Brandon Rogers.",
