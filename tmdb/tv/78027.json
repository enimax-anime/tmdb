She visits Paris, where two operas captured the spirit of Bohemianism that swept the city - Bizet's Carmen, that showed the gritty realities of life for Paris's underclass and the upper classes' fear of them, and Puccini's classic opera La Boheme, about the lives and loves of a group of young people exploring the new personal and sexual freedoms available.

Historian Lucy Worsley explores how history and opera go hand in hand. She visits the great European cities where some of the most famous operas were written, tells the stories of the colourful characters who composed them, and shows how they reflected the turbulent times they were composed in and the lives, hopes and fears of the people who lived in them. Whilst Lucy visits the cities and European opera houses, Antonio Pappano, music director of London's Royal Opera, helps us understand some of those operas' greatest musical moments.","popularity":1.4,"poster_path":"/iiASAC8fkMrdShLYHj1hxw8LfsG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2017-10-14","episode_count":2,"id":100804,"name":"Miniseries","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5aa70eedc3a36839da0124ed","air_date":"2017-10-14","episodes":[{"air_date":"2017-10-14","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1453538,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"In the first episode, Lucy investigates four cities and four operas embedded in the cauldron of European politics between the 17th and 19th centuries.
