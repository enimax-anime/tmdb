Through a series of intimate interviews between Steamboat and his peers, including greatest rival Ric Flair, this episode peels back layers to reveal a more personal Ricky, from his humble beginnings as a military brat, unshakeable family values, trials and triumphs, all culminating in the legendary bouts that sealed his place as an icon in sports-entertainment history.",
