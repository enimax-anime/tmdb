With his right hand, John Diggle, back in the military and his sister Thea adamant about hanging up her vigilante hood as Speedy, Team Green Arrow is down to just Oliver and Felicity – but they’re no longer the only vigilantes in town. Green Arrow’s public defeat of Damien Darhk at the end of Season Four has inspired a new crop of masked heroes to step up and defend the city, though their painful inexperience makes them obstacles rather than allies in the field. The arrival of a deadly new adversary will force Oliver to confront questions about his own legacy, both as mayor and as the Green Arrow.","id":79710,"poster_path":"/uzGRZtaDTh0nKruS0raXVZnGQAj.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":7.4},"6":{"_id":"596393e49251415a400c64e8","air_date":"2017-10-12","episodes":[{"air_date":"2017-10-12","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1336644,"name":"Fallout","overview":"Oliver deals with the fallout of the explosion on the island.","production_code":"T27.13451","runtime":42,"season_number":6,"show_id":1412,"still_path":"/tku04rIOjFHIwdkjeSGi6DQiOQp.jpg","vote_average":7,"vote_count":27,"crew":[{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"55ae6a39c3a3682ff400c11c","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":171830,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marc Guggenheim","original_name":"Marc Guggenheim","popularity":2.019,"profile_path":"/zWZdt5nteG3E73bZDNAp1LdPRQ.jpg"},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5885292892514104570229d6","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1371443,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wendy Mericle","original_name":"Wendy Mericle","popularity":2.112,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"56004348c3a3685f51000192","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":113194,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"James Bamford","original_name":"James Bamford","popularity":2.946,"profile_path":"/nINKWQ3ej0aYNsP1kmybVASObAE.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Alex Faust","credit_id":"5ac15709c3a3682d9a00e5fc","order":615,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1122102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dominic Bogart","original_name":"Dominic Bogart","popularity":1.906,"profile_path":"/dUb5kOCWVHIYmoAfMEGR3hunTiD.jpg"},{"character":"Slade Wilson / Deathstroke","credit_id":"5ac154520e0a260c3900f666","order":676,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":41782,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Manu Bennett","original_name":"Manu Bennett","popularity":14.702,"profile_path":"/vSIWn2lQuk0fRe6faqusZCiMSWz.jpg"},{"character":"Frank Pike","credit_id":"56f38e67c3a3682fd2001f1f","order":1334,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adrian Holmes","original_name":"Adrian Holmes","popularity":8.739,"profile_path":"/8gfuxasIm5nPx0FccAJQ6JaYxcy.jpg"},{"character":"Samantha Clayton","credit_id":"56cfa687c3a3681e44004cbb","order":1364,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":208539,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anna Hopkins","original_name":"Anna Hopkins","popularity":12.544,"profile_path":"/uL44Lc0ql6y3bmuGz9r7NvhBSKR.jpg"},{"character":"Officer Bob Goodwin","credit_id":"5edf8ac9f36a32001f8d6697","order":1369,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2259669,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ryan Jinn","original_name":"Ryan Jinn","popularity":5.772,"profile_path":"/ubwql1D3uR2FeRHFnYDibYeOFtp.jpg"},{"character":"Large Cobalt","credit_id":"5edf8ae1f36a32001f8d66b4","order":1370,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1846337,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eli Martyr","original_name":"Eli Martyr","popularity":5.381,"profile_path":"/z9ZCWgP4bRMzxsUiKN82tSMgMM2.jpg"},{"character":"Raisa","credit_id":"56cc5aeb925141245e002602","order":1462,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":23625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kathleen Gati","original_name":"Kathleen Gati","popularity":5.216,"profile_path":"/fpw1NCXX1aVZaLk6RbcYhEY48PZ.jpg"},{"character":"Bethany Snow","credit_id":"55b026bc9251411e1800c963","order":1589,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1489550,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keri Adams","original_name":"Keri Adams","popularity":2.201,"profile_path":"/t3y2zjhafvMwVwhdOyrrVNq2YOo.jpg"},{"character":"William","credit_id":"5c4c9b740e0a260419d108d1","order":1624,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1761125,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jack Moore","original_name":"Jack Moore","popularity":1.33,"profile_path":"/xvUmqGDtMs62CJYQooA6fPGK2EE.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2017-10-19","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1351687,"name":"Tribute","overview":"Oliver tries to balance being the mayor, Green Arrow and a father to William.
