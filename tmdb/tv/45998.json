Riko wins a chance to kiss Keita in front of everyone, but is too embarrassed to do it. Miharu gets the remaining prize, to spend ten minutes in the equipment room alone with Keita to do anything. Keita simply uses the time to thank Miharu, but after a slip up, they end up in a compromising position, leading Ako and Riko to assume the worst. Later that night whilst Keita goes to sleep, Ako and Riko make a move on him, though this just gives Keita weird dreams.","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":1,"show_id":45998,"still_path":"/rZKll1cTizSkcbdxPAl89RUN1GQ.jpg","vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"job":"Key Animation","department":"Visual Effects","credit_id":"62755994323eba0066cd7062","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2922690,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Naotaka Hayashi","original_name":"Naotaka Hayashi","popularity":1.712,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"62755a519450fe0051eed909","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1451777,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Katsumi Hasegawa","original_name":"Katsumi Hasegawa","popularity":0.891,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":54392,"poster_path":"/ixT9GVnHhMUdNWtY3yPXRakU0iU.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7.7}}}
