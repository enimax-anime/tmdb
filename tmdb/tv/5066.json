Born Gary Leon Ridgway on February 18, 1949, in Salt Lake City, Utah. Raised near Seattle’s Pacific Highway, a deprived neighborhood near SeaTac airport, Ridgway was a poor student and was sent to Vietnam after high school. When he returned, he got a job painting trucks, which he kept for 30 years. Though he married three times and was fanatical about religion, Ridgway was a frequent customer of prostitutes.\n\nRidgway’s slayings began in 1982, when young runaways and prostitutes began disappearing from state Route 99 in south King County, Washington. He brought many of them to his home and strangled them, then left them in woodsy, remote sites. The first few bodies turned up along the now-notorious Green River.\n\nDubbed the Green River Killer, Ridgway eluded the law until 2001, when King County sheriff Dave Reichert—the first officer assigned to the case in 1982—called a meeting to re-examine evidence using newly developed DNA-testing technology. The analysis produced a match between evidence from the victims and Ridgway, and he was charged with four counts of aggravated murder in December 2001. Ridgway eventually pleaded guilty to 48 counts of aggravated first-degree murder.\n\nFacing the prospect of execution, Ridgway told investigators that he killed as many as 60 women, and revealed where he'd hidden the bodies of four young women who had never been found. He was sentenced to life in prison in December 2003 having committed more murders than any serial killer in U.S. history.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":5066,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-09-13","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":349619,"name":"A Murder in Greenwich:  The Martha Moxley Case","overview":"A Murder in Greenwich: The Martha Moxley Case from the Biography Channel series Notorious follows a complex case of murder among the elite of Greenwich, Connecticut.

After taunting investigators through the press, the BTK Killer dropped out of sight. But in early 2004, his own ego tripped him up. Now we know that the BTK Killer is Dennis Rader, a regular churchgoer and member of that same community he terrorized for decades. In an unprecedented courtroom confession, the infamous serial killer described 10 of his murders in dispassionate detail. But who is the man behind the BTK Killer, and what made him do it? Through interviews with investigators and experts, people who knew Rader and his victims, and through the words of Rader himself, this special will reveal insights into what drove Rader to become a killer, and how he evaded capture for so many years.
