The show was the creation of producer Robert Maxwell and animal trainer Rudd Weatherwax and was televised from September 12, 1954, to March 24, 1973. One of the longest-running series on television, the show chalked up seventeen seasons on CBS before entering first-run syndication for its final two seasons. Initially filmed in black and white, the show transitioned to color in 1965.\n\nThe show's first ten seasons follow Lassie's adventures in a small farming community. Fictional eleven-year-old Jeff Miller, his mother, and his grandfather are Lassie's first human companions until seven-year-old Timmy Martin and his adoptive parents take over in the fourth season. When Lassie's exploits on the farm end in the eleventh season, she finds new adventures in the wilderness with a succession of United States Forest Service Rangers. After traveling without human leads for a year, Lassie finally settles at a children's home for her final two syndicated seasons.\n\nLassie received critical favor at its debut and won two Emmy Awards in its first years. Stars Jan Clayton and June Lockhart were nominated for Emmys. Merchandise produced during the show's run included books, a Halloween costume, clothing, toys, and other items. Campbell's Soup, the show's lifelong sponsor, offered two premiums, and distributed thousands to fans. A multi-part episode was edited into the feature film Lassie's Great Adventure and released in August 1963. In 1989, the television series The New Lassie brought Lassie star Jon Provost back to television as Steve McCullough. Selected episodes have been released to DVD.","popularity":56.407,"poster_path":"/vqbVr4fYRZb28ywczaidn29JJTA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1963-02-13","episode_count":6,"id":15468,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/AaWD8LnjmQQCvUDnyqhkKx3u518.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1954-09-12","episode_count":26,"id":15451,"name":"Season 1","overview":"The first season of the television series Lassie premiered in the United States on CBS on September 12, 1954 and ran for 26 episodes until its conclusion on March 6, 1955.
