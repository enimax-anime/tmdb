The series was created by Stu Silver.\n\nThe show stars Emmanuel Lewis in the title role as a young boy who, after losing his parents, is adopted by his NFL-pro godfather, portrayed by Alex Karras, and his new socialite wife, played by Susan Clark. The focus was largely on how this impulsively married couple had to adjust to their new lives and sudden parenthood, but it was the congenial Webster himself who drove much of the plot. The series was produced by Georgian Bay Ltd., Emmanuel Lewis Entertainment Enterprises, Inc. and Paramount Television.\n\nLike NBC's earlier hit Diff'rent Strokes, Webster featured a young African-American boy adopted by a white family.","popularity":16.093,"poster_path":"/4eBuBuPBzizq3QKBzFA7dVYW6Uk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":9223,"logo_path":"/of4mmVt6egYaO9oERJbuUxMOTkj.png","name":"Paramount Television Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":77166,"logo_path":null,"name":"Emmanuel Lewis Entertainment Enterprises","origin_country":""},{"id":48743,"logo_path":null,"name":"Georgian Bay Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1983-09-16","episode_count":22,"id":11416,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/lQmqX3QCru6Th2NWIz1gJI9WMWv.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1984-09-21","episode_count":26,"id":11417,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/lqlCbJGSOqZhv6MpWyYm9j1RV1r.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1985-09-20","episode_count":29,"id":11419,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1986-08-20","episode_count":22,"id":11418,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1987-09-21","episode_count":25,"id":11420,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1988-09-09","episode_count":25,"id":11421,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":6,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":27,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5257572319c29531db14b6ff","air_date":"1983-09-16","episodes":[{"air_date":"1983-09-16","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":2012377,"name":"Another Ballgame","overview":"After the untimely death of a young boy's parents, he is sent to live with his father's best friend.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":3804,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1983-09-23","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":266638,"name":"Happy Un-Birthday","overview":"In oder to get some extra special attention, Webster makes believe that it is his birthday and wants a party.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":3804,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257572319c29531db14b78c","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54644,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Joel Zwick","original_name":"Joel Zwick","popularity":1.926,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"5257572419c29531db14b8af","order":508,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8874,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ernie Hudson","original_name":"Ernie Hudson","popularity":21.592,"profile_path":"/kgAdQA2ItCDVvKXufeDHc6Omiso.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1983-09-30","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":266644,"name":"Consulting Adults","overview":"Webster tries out for the football team.
