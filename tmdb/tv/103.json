It has advanced electrical equipment, and they are attacked by an overalled man. He collapses dead, then gets up and disappears in a cloud of smoke. They go upstairs and are paralyzed by an alien-android disguised as an old woman. The aliens are preparing to steal Earth's oxygen. The Project staff execute a lateral transfer and free the guys. They escape to a seemingly empty town surrounded by a force field and filled with paralyzed townspeople. A young couple, Paul and Joan, find the guys and tell them about the oxygen-stealing plot. Meanwhile the alien androids infiltrate the Project base, seal it off, and start sucking out the oxygen through the Tunnel itself. The guys must destroy the operation at their end. They fight off the androids and use explosives to blow up the alien HQ.","vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"air_date":"1967-04-07","episode_number":30,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"9630","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":103,"still_path":"/imKl5qKvdpulNbzXuLEISGTPaV2.jpg"},"name":"The Time Tunnel","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":2,"logo_path":"/2uy2ZWcplrSObIyt4x0Y9rkG6qO.png","name":"ABC","origin_country":"US"}],"number_of_episodes":30,"number_of_seasons":1,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"The Time Tunnel","overview":"The Time Tunnel is a 1966â€“1967 U.S. color science fiction TV series, written around a theme of time travel adventure.

He takes the guys out of time and freezes them, commands them to do his bidding, then sends them on to 544 A.D., Cornwall England. They meet a young pre-King Arthur while fighting Vikings and on Merlin's behest team up with Arthur. The Vikings apparently kill Doug and capture Tony and Arthur. Tony escapes with Arthur and Doug is rescued by Merlin and Guienvere. When the Project staff are ready to recover Doug and Tony, Merlin intervenes because he needs them where they are. Tony and Arthur get recaptured and so does Doug when he goes to help. Guinevere gets captured too. One of the Vikings kills Arthur and a \"\"detained\"\" Merlin shows up and reverses time to save him. The guys escape again and Doug gets reinforcements which Merlin disguises as Vikings while Arthur and Tony rescue Guinevere. Everything works out and Arthur and Guinevere are to be married.","production_code":"9628","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":103,"still_path":"/MHoHxAwYGGXjznQTsbS32mztYN.jpg","vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5253391019c295794005a8dd","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112567,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Harry Harris","original_name":"Harry Harris","popularity":3.842,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"58a108839251412b700050ba","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":29323,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"William Welch","original_name":"William Welch","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","credit_id":"5e71bf548de0ae0013557e29","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22085,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Winton C.
