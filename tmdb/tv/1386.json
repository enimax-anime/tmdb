The eccentric landlady asks nothing more than for the man to provide her with plenty of garbage for the disposal unit. The man is puzzled when the walls ooze blood after he attempts to hang a picture with a nail and hammer. He is further disturbed when the floor shakes as he hears an ominous roar bellow throughout the building complex.

Although it lives at the North Pole, its humongous ears allow it to hear its name being spoken from anywhere in the world, and the parents assure the children that The Grither is well on its way to their house to kill them. The children become progressively more frightened as the story continues, eventually to the point of utter hysteria.

He seems oblivious to everything bad around him. We soon realize that a small demon, a Yattering, has been sent to torment him because his mother was a witch. The Yattering's boss tells him he can do anything he wants as long as he doesn't touch Jack. Jack's daughter comes to visit, and she is surprised at both the host of strange occurrences (including an animated Christmas turkey) that occur, and her father's increasingly strident attempts to deny anything amiss. His motto:  \"\"Que Sara Sara\"\". Finally, driven out of its mind with desperation, the Yattering touches Jack...which makes him his willing servant. Jack knew of the demon's plans all along, and that he hoped to trick it into touching him. Now he is safe from Hell's revenge, and has a new servant in the process.","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":4,"show_id":1386,"still_path":"/4iyaEnzNlHI4frtAN6Nkhecoaj4.jpg","vote_average":4,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52541d7319c29570ba017860","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31211,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Clive Barker","original_name":"Clive Barker","popularity":3.471,"profile_path":"/h6JebwvNTpOquhJGrmDh8zCYjQZ.jpg"},{"job":"Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"603e63a32f8d09005a200d39","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1435277,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Greg Schorer","original_name":"Greg Schorer","popularity":0.84,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"605f96f01511aa0054948df5","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58337,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Odell","original_name":"David Odell","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","credit_id":"605f97268f26bc00559d64a8","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1096222,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Gideon Porath","original_name":"Gideon Porath","popularity":1.045,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Jack Polo","credit_id":"52541d7319c29570ba017840","order":517,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Antony Carbone","original_name":"Antony Carbone","popularity":3.129,"profile_path":"/6AQ8FrC8A6RPoctlisDidekPv2x.jpg"},{"character":"The Yattering","credit_id":"605f976fa39d0b006a3f6004","order":614,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":12662,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phil Fondacaro","original_name":"Phil Fondacaro","popularity":8.305,"profile_path":"/vJbPx90IzOdE6L1maYu1HIJayjG.jpg"},{"character":"Beelzebub","credit_id":"605f9811d7fbda003d55711f","order":615,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1607608,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Newman","original_name":"Thomas Newman","popularity":0.728,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Amanda Polo","credit_id":"605f9847d7fbda0054b52ea7","order":616,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1216966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danielle Brisebois","original_name":"Danielle Brisebois","popularity":3.511,"profile_path":"/plAB3zzm0uXtZ3ljmhSUccphJUe.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1987-11-15","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"standard","id":61500,"name":"Seymourlama","overview":"Much to his parents' frustration, a spoiled young boy, Seymour, is declared the High Lama by a group of monks.","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":4,"show_id":1386,"still_path":"/dXLng7ziJOoq1Qp7hMcWqYIP2jl.jpg","vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"52541d7419c29570ba0179b8","order":507,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1216574,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"J.D.
