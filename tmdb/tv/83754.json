The chefs are also paired up to compete as a team using an nontraditional Thanksgiving protein. In the dinner round, the chefs compete solo, making a dinner that incorporates a protein, veggie, starch and sweet from Giada's Black Friday table. Judges Alex Guarnaschelli, Carla Hall and Christian Petroni decide which chef heads home while the others move on to the finale.",
