Pat was irked at Alice for being suspicious that their father, Jim, was spending a lot of time at Liz's house that evening. Alice needled Pat that because she bought a car, she can't afford to live on campus and so was forced to share a room with Alice at home.

Dru assured John he had done everything he could for Pat. Adams considered Phil's \"\"a woman wronged\"\" approach melodramatic, but Phil anticipated it as John's strategy and was ready to deny Tom as the baby's father if John trotted a baby into court. Larry recommended that Tony should have had a psychiatrist look at Pat, and even wanted to bet $5 that one would be brought in to the trial.

In his opening remarks, John instructed the jury that the picture puzzle of the trial would not be complete until the last piece was fitted into its proper place. John objected to Phil's attempt to arouse the jury's sympathy for the first witness, Ken. Ken told Phil he looked at his son's dead body at the County Morgue on November 7th. The judge sustained Phil's objection to John's characterization of Tom as a ladies' man. John harped on Ken's separation from Laura until Phil objected. The coroner, Dr. Robert Wolf, testified that Tom died from a massive hemorrhage of the abdominal cavity (in other words, he bled to death) from a gunshot beneath the sternum. Wolf identified the bullet (State's Exhibit No. 1) and estimated time of death as between 6:30 and 8:30 p.m.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":4547,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1965-01-06","episode_number":168,"episode_type":"finale","id":324274,"name":"Paragon of Virtue","overview":"A furious Pat rebuked John for smearing Tom's name, and he warned her not to testify Tom was a paragon of virtue. Dru couldn't fathom why John insisted on telling off and antagonizing Pat. The following morning, John begged Pat to have the same faith in him she had in Dr. Warren. Judge Sutherland berated John and Phil for playing on the jury's emotions yesterday. The crime lab technician, Peter Jordan, testified he found Pat's fingerprints on Exhibit No. 2, the 32-caliber pistol. John declined to question Jordan. On the stand, Adams recounted what happened when he went to Tom's apartment. As Adams described telling Mary and Jim he believed their daughter was with Tom Baxter that night, Pat stood up and shouted she wasn't there, to ensuing court
