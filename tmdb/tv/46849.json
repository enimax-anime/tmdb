Charlotte gets used to seeing blood as she works near the front-line. Greta sleeps with a major in the Gestapo to advance her career as a singer, and to obtain documents for Viktor to flee to New York City, since the rights of Jews are being diminished.

Wilhelm gets wounded and left for dead. When he wakes up, instead of going back to the base, he finds a cabin by a lake and lives on his own for a few weeks. He is discovered by the German Army and sentenced to death for desertion. Friedhelm is sent back home, but seeing his father's disappointment with Wilhelm's apparent death, and lack of appreciation for his survival, he enlists again. Viktor escapes the Germans and joins a group of Polish partisans, but tries to conceal his Jewish race because they hate Jews. Charlotte feels despair over Wilhelm's apparent death and starts an affair with a military doctor. Greta visits the front-line and becomes disillusioned by what she discovers there.
