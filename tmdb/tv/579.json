The live finale aired on May 25, 2010.\n\nThe season premiered on NBC on January 5, 2010 and tallied its best premiere rating ever, powering NBC to the adults 18-49 ratings win for that night. Biggest Loser: Couples was up 2% from its January, 2009 premiere to a 4.6 adults 18-49 rating. It was the top adults 18-49 rated Biggest Loser premiere and tied the second best rating for a non-finale. It scored a total 11.68 million viewers.\n\nThis was also the last season to be filmed in 480i, due to the fall 2010 season moving to high definition.","id":1774,"poster_path":null,"season_number":9,"vote_average":0},"10":{"_id":"525388b319c295794022c2c6","air_date":"2010-09-21","episodes":[{"air_date":"2010-09-21","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":33630,"name":"Week 1","overview":"In the 10th season premiere, Bob and Jillian travel across the U.S. to meet potential players for this season.","production_code":"","runtime":90,"season_number":10,"show_id":579,"still_path":"/mVpye8Vt7g54W2BJT2xF9K9RUpr.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-09-28","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":33631,"name":"Week 2","overview":"The Season 10 players have finally arrived on The Biggest Loser ranch and they meet with Ali.
