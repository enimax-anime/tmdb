The primary FBI investigator in the case was Terry Carter, whose partner was a victim of Hubbard. It featured Andrew Sikes as a recurring character trying to help McClain.\n\nDue to low ratings, the show was canceled after one year.","popularity":7.722,"poster_path":"/7yYI9WQb04tppocnokL48VIfZsG.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1996-09-12","episode_count":23,"id":7428,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52573474760ee3776a38db90","air_date":"1996-09-12","episodes":[{"air_date":"1996-09-12","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":178959,"name":"Unaired Pilot","overview":"This original pilot was turned down by CBS in 1995.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":2383,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52573474760ee3776a38dbaa","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":48965,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Anthony Hickox","original_name":"Anthony Hickox","popularity":3.356,"profile_path":"/oVhvHfrAsTdZn8i5NOnHwt1Eg2W.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Gus McClain","credit_id":"5ddef8b5c51acd0015f20ba3","order":501,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":68528,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Storke","original_name":"Adam Storke","popularity":9.031,"profile_path":"/1T5DDv2yjqyKTpqTWkbuwlRIue8.jpg"},{"character":"Elizabeth Gaitan","credit_id":"5ddef8cac51acd0011f2154f","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":7430,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elizabeth Peña","original_name":"Elizabeth Peña","popularity":8.918,"profile_path":"/uyUrPmtbwiGFOq8pIfYVQYgmBmK.jpg"},{"character":"Leon","credit_id":"5ddef8d73faba0001904ea4d","order":503,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":114894,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"C.
