                    "overview": "The Ghost Adventures team travels to West Palm Beach, FL, to investigate the Riddle House. Built in 1905 formerly called The Gatekeepers Cottage, the Riddle House was used as a funeral parlor and home to cemetery caretakers. Later it was used as a private residence. The house was moved from its original location, Acacia Rd, West Palm Beach, Florida. This seemed to have upset the spirits causing paranormal activity due to the house having seen its share of death and tragedy.",

                    "overview": "Between June and September of 1692, witch hysteria gripped the quiet village of Salem. Among the hundreds to have been accused of witchcraft, there lie twenty men and women who were executed as a result of this witch-hunt. A strange energy continues to haunt this New England town, which has become a mecca for real-life witches. Zak, Nick and Aaron travel to Salem to conduct a two-part lock-down. First, the guys start with Judge Jonathan Corwin's house-the only structure still standing in Salem with a direct connection to the Witch trials. They hope to confront the spirit of the man who helped send so many innocent people to their death. Then the Ghost Adventures crew ventures to the Lyceum, built on the land of the first victim of Salem's infamous witch trials. No matter where they investigate, Zak, Nick and Aaron will find that everywhere you turn in Salem is haunted by a paranormal influence that is still felt on every street corner and in every building.",
