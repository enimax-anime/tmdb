Richard Rakiere has the vital role of a ‘Gong Farmer’, or Nightman, and spends his hours of darkness emptying cesspits. We know about Richard because in 1326, his bizarre death was recorded, when he fell into his own cesspit and drowned.",

His first encounter is with someone you wouldn’t want to meet on a dark night, or any time, really. Richard Rakiere has the vital role of a ‘Gong Farmer’, or Nightman, and spends his hours of darkness emptying cesspits. We know about Richard because in 1326, his bizarre death was recorded, when he fell into his own cesspit and drowned.",
