The budget is $1,000 and everything in the room is fair game for change. From fabrics and furniture to flooring and fixture, our designers will join the neighbors in a race to redecorate. Frank will be transforming a den from southwest to superb and Laurie tackles a tiny kitchen that goes from functional to fabulous in just 48 hours â€” all with the help from carpenter, Amy Wynn Pastor.",

Hopefully he will be able to sleep without them once he sees the mature and classic room Edward creates for him.\n\nOutside carpenter Faber Dewar enjoys the sunshine as he builds some fabulous pieces for some fabulous rooms.

And because he couldn't take time off, he's doing his show live from his neighbor's house.

In spite of being shorthanded, designer Hildi Santo TomÃ¡s manages to pull off a kitchen redo that is pretty radical. Imagine that from Hildi!
