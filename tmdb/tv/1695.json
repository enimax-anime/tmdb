Monk Goes Back to School","overview":"When English teacher Beth Landow falls from the clock tower at Trudy's former high school, the assistant principal doubts the police department's conclusion that the death was a suicide and invites Monk to investigate. Monk quickly concludes that the suicide note is a forgery: a highly respected English teacher wouldn't confuse \"\"its\"\" with \"\"it's.\"\"  A few words with the teachers in the lounge lead him to suspect that the murderer is a science teacher, Derek Philby. Unfortunately for Monk, Philby was proctoring an SAT exam when Ms. Landow's body landed on Philby's car, setting off his car alarm and alerting the entire school to her death.

Disher, Monk and Sharona find him in Captain Stottlemeyer's office, drinking Scotch to console himself because his 58-year-old mother has married a 37-year-old antique dealer he's sure is up to no good. The con man, Dalton Padron, has taken his aging bride to a marriage counseling clinic for their honeymoon, and Sharona persuades Monk that the best way to catch him is to pose as husband and wife and join him at the clinic. In a group therapy session, Sharona accuses Padron of winking at her and, in the scuffle that follows, snatches an old letter from his jacket pocket.

But this time there's a further twist: the dead man's pet chimpanzee, Darwin, is caught with the murder weapon in his hand. Not wanting to make a monkey of himself by falsely accusing a chimpanzee of murder, Stottlemeyer takes the chimp into the interrogation room, tempting the animal to fire what he thinks is an empty gun. Meanwhile, Disher realizes that he's inadvertently given the captain a loaded gun and panic ensues. When the gun goes off, endangering not only Stottlemeyer but Disher, Monk, and Sharona as well, Stottlemeyer is persuaded that the chimp is guilty and is ready to allow animal control to put him to sleep. Sharona, however, is convinced that Darwin is innocent. In desperation, Sharona resorts to breaking and entering to rescue Darwin, persuading the most unlikely person imaginable to take

While Sharona and Dr. Kroger pressure Monk to call Michelle, Disher follows up on Monk's suggestion that the power outage is connected to a '90s radical named Winston Brenner. Everything fits--the handwriting in the note, the phrasing, even a pair of photographs. Everything except one small detail at the end of the report--Brenner died in 1995. When the FBI acknowledges the possibility that Brenner may have faked his own death to avoid a trial, Captain Stottlemeyer presents a tree-hugging former friend of Brenner's with the evidence that Brenner is still alive and reminds him that this particular power outage is also a homicide.

With a Mafia bodyguard named Vince as their \"\"babysitter,\"\" Monk and Sharona interview the sole witness, Phil Bedard, a young U.S. mint employee who tells them that he saw three men running from the scene, one of them wearing a jacket with a strange-looking number 15 on the back. Bedard also explains the heightened security at the mint: someone has stolen five double-headed pennies.

After several frightening and mysterious encounters with a blood-soaked man that no one else can see, she begins to doubt her own sanity, and Stottlemeyer advises Monk to give her time off to restore her nerves. Monk is left with an irritating substitute nurse whose philosophy is the opposite of Sharona's: everything from Monk's requests for wipes to the obsessively systematic organization of his refrigerator has to go. Wanting Sharona back again, Monk goes to the garage where Sharona first saw the blood-soaked man and finds a clue--the silver tip from the toe of a cowboy boot. Meanwhile Sharona, who is attending a night class in creative writing, apparently forgets to turn in an assignment and seems to be misplacing objects. But when her writing instructor's husband dies of a heart attack after eating tomato soup, Sharona recognizes the plot of her missing story and realizes that she's not crazy.

Show","overview":"With Sharona in New Jersey to visit her ailing mother, Monk is left in the very incompetent hands of his annoying upstairs neighbor, Kevin Dorfman, but the prospect of a week with Kevin is eased somewhat by a visit from Trudy's father, Dwight Ellison. Dwight invites Monk (and Kevin) to spend the week with him and his wife, Marcia – and at the same time investigate gameshow host Roddy Lankman, who appears to be involved in a conspiracy to allow one of his contestants, Val Birch, to win every game.

Unfortunately for Captain Stottlemeyer, his chief suspect has been dead for six years.

Searching the crime scene for clues, Monk notes that the bullet holes seem to form a pattern, but neither he nor Stottlemeyer can figure out the message they're intended to convey. After trying unsuccessfully to talk with Prager's young daughter, Monk goes under cover as Santa Claus. This time he learns  that Prager is hiding in a church with \"\"three ladies\"\" in front of it. But when Prager is caught and interrogated, it's clear that he had nothing to do with the poisoned wine.

But Inspector No. 8, the only shirt inspector who can meet Monk's criteria for perfection, is not up to her usual standards. Sensing that something is wrong, Monk visits No. 8 on the job. The inspector, Maria Ortiz, informs him that her son, Pablo, has been imprisoned for murdering a fashion model, but she's certain that he's innnocent. Monk is chiefly concerned about his shirts, but Natalie persuades him to talk to Pablo because \"\"it's the right thing to do.\"\" The conversation uncovers just one clue: Pablo can't read English. When Monk realizes that the killer must have been able to read an emergency exit sign, he's convinced that Pablo is innocent despite the DNA evidence used to convict him. With Stottlemeyer and Disher in tow, Monk and Natalie attempt to talk to the model's former roommate and the fashion designer she worked for, Julian Hodge. But now there's a new problem: Hodge wants thirteen-year-old Julie to model for him. Watching the rehearsal for a fashion show in which Julie will make her debut, Monk discovers a clue that points him to the real killer. When another supermodel is found dead, it's imperative that Monk find new evidence to prove his suspect guilty of both murders and set Pablo free--and for Natalie to get Julie away from the person committing the murders.","production_code":"T-2366","runtime":43,"season_number":4,"show_id":1695,"still_path":"/tgF9YNGENlNC7lp0quaNR1Op2gT.jpg","vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525710a219c2957114043bc2","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214368,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Randall

Marriage","overview":"During the investigation of a murder in a junkyard, Captain Stottlemeyer punches a cop named Ryan Sharkey, who claims to be having an affair with the captain's wife, Karen. The only witness to the murder, a homeless man named Gerald or Jerry, has disappeared, but Stottlemeyer suspects businessman Michael Karpov, who is facing charges for money laundering and had a motive for killing the victim, who was scheduled to testify against him. Removed from the case and ordered to take anger management classes, Stottlemeyer asks Monk and Natalie to follow his wife, whom he suspects of lying about her whereabouts. They discover Karen having lunch with a man but are only able to photograph him from the back before being interrupted. Meanwhile, the homeless witness has been stunned and thrown from the third floor of a building but survives the fall, thanks to a corrugated refrigerator carton. Disher places Karpov in a line-up otherwise composed of police officers, including Sharkey, but Stottlemeyer, still enraged at Sharkey, disrupts the line-up before the procedure has been completed. An apple provides the clue that Monk needs to solve the murder case, and Karen reveals the identity of the mystery man she had lunch with. Unfortunately for the captain, it isn't Sharkey.","production_code":"T-2363","runtime":42,"season_number":4,"show_id":1695,"still_path":"/dWVSsZSuAwsXeE5s3hldPP1F0xI.jpg","vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525710ed19c2957114047c8f","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29901,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jack Bernstein","original_name":"Jack Bernstein","popularity":2.113,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525710e319c2957114047278","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":198886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Philip Casnoff","original_name":"Philip Casnoff","popularity":8.476,"profile_path":"/rbPwxoP1vvZkWBVNiHqiOjI5Lag.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Peter","credit_id":"525710ec19c2957114047b41","order":545,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":175533,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael Bower","original_name":"Michael Bower","popularity":4.288,"profile_path":"/eDsEV805mHKkT7xblG3Wvp0zbHS.jpg"},{"character":"Ryan Sharkey","credit_id":"525710ec19c2957114047b6f","order":636,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicky Katt","original_name":"Nicky Katt","popularity":8.594,"profile_path":"/4IPdDqsSsDWmv2Uep5skdykJYij.jpg"},{"character":"Little Girl","credit_id":"525710ec19c2957114047b9d","order":700,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":220064,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kerris Dorsey","original_name":"Kerris Dorsey","popularity":5.352,"profile_path":"/xCp5jjjzh25iBrXtVV0rzolZGR5.jpg"},{"character":"Michael Karpov","credit_id":"525710ec19c2957114047bd1","order":844,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":42747,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Misha Collins","original_name":"Misha Collins","popularity":16.385,"profile_path":"/szigprnenokR4yOpELIB2rj1Er2.jpg"},{"character":"Karen Stottlemeyer","credit_id":"525710b919c2957114044bc9","order":870,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21104,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Glenne Headly","original_name":"Glenne Headly","popularity":10.741,"profile_path":"/ucndAdXmTfF6PfZx3tIMOOOOGcL.jpg"},{"character":"Gerald Vengal","credit_id":"525710ec19c2957114047bff","order":897,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":129661,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bob Clendenin","original_name":"Bob Clendenin","popularity":4.68,"profile_path":"/bB8teXzKyQsJ4avnPLqbkSww23R.jpg"},{"character":"Dr. Bradley","credit_id":"525710ec19c2957114047c2d","order":935,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":102579,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kitty Swink","original_name":"Kitty Swink","popularity":2.917,"profile_path":"/lZgGZldkVEPk7neSQjqOFuow8r8.jpg"},{"character":"Det.

Unfortunately, they have competition in the form of a retired Scotland Yard investigator, a bounty hunter, and a gadget-loving private detective, all of whom want the reward money for themselves. Monk quickly figures out that the heist was an inside job and that one of the robbers was under five feet tall, short enough to hide inside a roll-top desk. He also discovers a clue linking a perpetrator to a transcendental meditation retreat. With their competitors close behind them, Monk and Natalie head for the retreat, where they find the thief, who is unfortunately dead. Meanwhile, Disher is having to interrogate a strange young woman who keeps turning herself in for such \"\"crimes\"\" as stealing pens or murdering a hamster. Monk tells Natalie that he's solved the case and they race to the police station with the other detectives following. The only thing left is to find the diamond before their competitors
