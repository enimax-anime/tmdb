With only 1-2 weeks to fix the issue and nurse the plants back to health, Jim has no choice but to stay back on the farm and send Larry to Mississippi in his place. A decision Chris adamantly disagrees with. Larry has finally started to find his footing in Oregon. But will he buckle under the pressure of walking a mile in Jim's shoes?",
