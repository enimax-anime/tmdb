Brilliant, reclusive, and the subject of relentless media scrutiny, he’s never spoken publicly—until now. During interviews with Andrew Jarecki, he reveals secrets of the case that baffled authorities for 30 years. In 2010, Jarecki made the narrative film All Good Things based on the infamous story of Robert Durst. After Durst saw the film, he contacted Jarecki wanting to tell his story. What began as a feature documentary ultimately became a six-part series as more and more of his incredible story was revealed.","popularity":10.494,"poster_path":"/qY3rk9hH6dzgDrIkonxxHBF3rp8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3268,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6523,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hit the Ground Running Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":68884,"logo_path":"/1BYexT6Vikz4ulCcYKGPmOi6Jm0.png","name":"Blumhouse Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2015-02-08","episode_count":6,"id":64692,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/jGF7kwU7YLtw4aqDekEe3O1ITZ7.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7.9}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"Four decades.
