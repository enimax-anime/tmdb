However, in 2000, Jennifer Saunders created and wrote a television pilot for a proposed new series, Mirrorball, in which she intended to reunite the cast of Absolutely Fabulous in new roles and a different plot. Saunders, along with Joanna Lumley, Julia Sawalha, Jane Horrocks and June Whitfield, returned for the pilot, but the series was never commissioned. Nevertheless, Mirrorball inspired Saunders to revive Absolutely Fabulous and a fourth series was produced. A Christmas special, \"Gay\" (titled \"Absolutely Fabulous in New York\" in the United States), was produced following the fourth series and was broadcast in 2002.","id":13455,"poster_path":"/12U9g4RpLiwoqXKlb6JwiOWGAPI.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":7.1},"5":{"_id":"52576bee760ee36aaa3fafba","air_date":"2003-10-17","episodes":[{"air_date":"2003-10-17","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":313927,"name":"Cleanin'","overview":"Edina's home is a mess, and she has done some more remodelling as usual.
