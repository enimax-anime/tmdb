Supporters of this initiative voted to preserve the sanctity of marriage solely between a man and a woman. Opponents of Prop 8 say it violates the constitutional rights of the gay community and that America’s laws should treat everyone equally. Since Election Day, numerous protests and rallies have been organized to overturn the law, and the debates are getting heated regarding this highly personal and controversial topic. Dr. Phil’s guests debate their opposing points of view: Discrimination attorney Gloria Allred, president of the Human Rights Campaign Joe Solmonese, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, Pastor Jim Garlow, president of National Organization of Marriage Maggie Gallagher and co-campaign manager for the Yes on 8 Campaign Jeff Flint.

Is your spouse being unfaithful? Jessica says she caught her husband of two and a half years, Ryan, having an affair with his ex-wife, April, whom she thought was her friend. Ryan admits to having a one-time only rendezvous with April, but April says it occurred closer to 60 times. Who's telling the truth? Jessica fears her husband and April are still keeping secrets from her. Because Ryan and April share custody of a son, Jessica laid down specific rules for when they interact. Are these stipulations keeping Ryan's behavior in check? After Dr. Phil sends Ryan backstage to have a private conversation with his wife, does he admit to more than the one-night fling with April? Will Jessica decide to rebuild the bond with her husband or cut him loose? Then, Daniel admitted to his wife, Karen, that he had an emotional affair with a woman he met online. Only days before coming to the show, he confessed that the affair was sexual. He says he's sorry and wants to put his family back together, but will Karen take him back?",

Just how far would you go to stay in the black? Laura and her husband, Allen, say they’ve made nearly $1 million in the last six years. There’s just one problem –- they don’t have jobs! Self-proclaimed professional shoplifters, the couple says they travel across state lines to steal TVs, toys, electronics and more –- and they often take their three young children along on their heists. They videotape themselves to show Dr. Phil how they get away with nabbing big-ticket items. Do Laura and Allen just get a thrill from thievery, or are they kleptomaniacs? Can the couple quit for good before they get arrested and lose their children? Then, Tami and Chris have a beautiful house, three cars and two children. But Tami says her husband is shattering their idyllic home life with his shoplifting addiction. She says he’s been arrested four times and was recently sentenced to 90 days in state prison. Chris joins Dr. Phil via satellite from jail to tell his side of the story. Find out why he says he can’t stop stealing, but when he hears his 4-year-old daughter's emotional plea, will he change his mind? And, Tami’s mom, Marilyn, calls Chris a pathological liar and says her daughter needs to kick him to the curb. Is Chris beyond redemption? Will he be able to clean up his act?",

Supporters of this initiative voted to preserve the sanctity of marriage solely between a man and a woman. Opponents of Prop 8 say it violates the constitutional rights of the gay community and that America’s laws should treat everyone equally. Since Election Day, numerous protests and rallies have been organized to overturn the law, and the debates are getting heated regarding this highly personal and controversial topic. Dr. Phil’s guests debate their opposing points of view: Discrimination attorney Gloria Allred, president of the Human Rights Campaign Joe Solmonese, San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom, Pastor Jim Garlow, president of National Organization of Marriage Maggie Gallagher and co-campaign manager for the Yes on 8 Campaign Jeff Flint.

                    "overview": "When you send your children to school, you expect them to be taught in a nurturing environment. But what should you do if you learn your child has experienced extreme discipline by those entrusted to teach him or her? Eva and Doug's autistic daughter, Isabel, was 8 years old when her teachers claimed her behavior became too difficult to handle, so they sent her to the Time-Out room. Cameras captured Isabel's time spent in isolation, which her parents say lasted for over three hours. Her parents say they had worked with the teachers regarding disciplining Isabel and were panicked and horrified when they saw the footage. Next, Martha says her 12-year-old daughter was in a classroom when $42 went missing. In an effort to find the money, a group of girls were strip-searched. You won't believe who reportedly ordered the investigation. Martha says her daughter is devastated and will never be the same. Then, when 5-year-old Gabriel constantly complained that his teacher was mean and yelled at him, his mom, Tabitha, sent him to school with a tape recorder in his pocket. Hear the audio recordings and find out the shocking information Tabitha discovered. Psychologist Ken Merrell, special education teacher Kathy Riley and civil litigation attorney Areva Martin weigh in on these cases. And, after years of being relentlessly bullied by fellow students, Jeremiah brought the torment to a tragic end. His father, Jeff, joins Dr. Phil and Jay McGraw to speak for the first time on television.",

What happens if you call and can’t get the help you need or emergency personnel are sent to the wrong address?America's 911 system handles nearly 240 million calls per year, and the growing number of dispatch disasters can be a matter of life or death. Edward and Ada know about this pain firsthand. They lost their loved one, Olidia, to a murder-suicide in the parking lot of a police station after what they say was a botched 911 call. Edward says his mom’s death could have been prevented, and Ada believes the operator was rude to her sister in the final moments before her murder. Joining Dr. Phil to discuss the tragedy are Charlie Cullen from the National Emergency Number Association and Caroline Burau, a 911 dispatcher and author of Answering 911: Life in the Hot Seat. Find out the most important piece of information you need to know when calling for help. Then, Nathan’s wife, Denise Amber Lee, was abducted, and a series of 911 calls -- even one placed by Denise herself -- failed to save the young mom’s life. Jane, a witness to Denise’s abduction, was on the line with 911 for more than nine minutes … but police were never dispatched. Now Nathan says he's angry with the system and has trouble explaining Denise’s death to their two young sons. What can the grieving father do to move past the pain? And, learn what constitutes a genuine emergency, and what to teach your kids about dialing those three important numbers.",

Recently, police were called to a fitness club in Tracy, California where an emaciated and half-naked teen boy stumbled in, covered in soot and bruises with a shackle on his ankle. The boy told a terrifying story of escaping from a house where he was kept prisoner, locked in chains, beaten and starved. Nancy Grace has some strong words for the boy’s alleged captors. Then, an Arizona town was recently rocked by the news of an 8-year-old boy arrested for allegedly shooting and killing his father and another man.

A heated debate ensues between Paul and Nancy. Plus, 13-year-old Tyler falsely confessed to the murder of his brother-in-law. He was tried as adult, sentenced to life in prison and served six years before being exonerated from the crime. Now 19, Tyler shares what made him lie to the police.

Dr. Phil speaks with two families who are on the verge of doing just that! Melissa says she has the mother-in-law from hell who is obsessed with her son, Tyson, Melissa’s husband. Melissa says Betty accuses her of stealing her son and brainwashing him to reverse his vasectomy, and she’s gone so far as to ask a stranger online to spy on the couple and report back. Betty says Tyson is no longer the same person since he married Melissa, and she just wants him back in her life. Whose side does Tyson take? Then, Pat and Rosie are sisters embroiled in a 10-year feud over their deceased father’s house and will. Civil and family attorney Areva Martin weighs in from a legal perspective. Dr. Phil wants to know: Is a house worth tearing apart a sibling relationship?",

She says the ritzy rewards motivate her kids to excel in the classroom, but her sister, Natalya, thinks she’s spoiling them. Find out what Dr. Phil thinks about this heated family debate. Then, Sarge and Joy raise their kids under a military-style regimen that bans most television shows, contact with friends, Harry Potter books and even requires the children to do push-ups if they lose a board game. Joy’s half-sister, Shana, worries the children will become sheltered from such a strict upbringing. Are they too radical, or is there a rationale to their extremes? Weigh in! And, Cheryl made national headlines when she allowed her 5-year-old son, Dyson, to wear princess dresses to school. Dr. Phil sits down with the mom to talk about her recently published children’s book, My Princess Boy, and talks about her decision to accept Dyson, no matter what he wears.",

Justin and his sister, Brianne, say their stepfather is a bully whose name-calling and tough love has backfired and made the situation worse. Bill says he's only trying to motivate Justin. Can Dr. Phil give these parents the tools they need to help Justin stand on his own two feet? And, Kris makes her living as a college prep advisor but admits she can't motivate her own sons to excel at anything other than mooching. In fact, both of her sons have dropped out of college! Twenty-year-old Charlie says he's racked up so many legal fees from the trouble he's caused that he can't afford to move out, and his 19-year-old brother, Cody, appears to be following in his footsteps. Can these parents help their adult children find their independence? Don't miss Dr. Phil's advice for parents who want to raise motivated and contributing adults!",

Todd says he was shocked and appalled when his ex-girlfriend's mother, Diana, accused him of molesting his 4-year-old daughter, Taniya, and turns to Dr. Phil to help clear his name. Diana says that while babysitting Taniya, the toddler detailed ways in which Todd inappropriately touched her, and she's convinced he's done the unthinkable. After learning of the accusations, Taniya's mom, Latia, reported the alleged sexual abuse to a judge who immediately stripped Todd of his parental rights -- but was justice served? Latia says that as much as she wants to believe Todd's innocence, as a mother, she needs to take every precaution to protect her child. A year has passed since he's seen his daughter, and Todd says he will go to any length to prove his innocence, including taking another a lie detector test — even though he's already passed one. He's adamant that Diana is lying and says that she coached Taniya to make the accusations. Dr. Phil calls in an expert polygraph examiner. Don't miss the shocking results!",

But Pauline is also a mother, daughter and friend with hopes and dreams of a better life for herself and her 18-year-old son and caregiver, Dillon. At her current size, Pauline's mobility is severely challenged. Just a few steps cause her pain, and she needs her sons help to stand up, get dressed and even go to the bathroom. It took an ambulance, a second support vehicle and a five-man crew to help her make the 400-mile trip to the Dr. Phil studio. Pauline says that while it's a daunting task, shes ready to start losing the weight. But what does Dr. Phil think? And what does Dillon have to say? How does his mother's disability impact his life? Is he following in her footsteps? Then, Pauline's ex-husband, Alex, says he loved Pauline despite her weight, but it wasn't enough to save their relationship. Where does he say it went wrong? Plus, Ruby, star of the Style Network show of the same name, knows what Pauline is going through because she was once 700 pounds and has lost 400. She offers her support and encouragement to Pauline. Is she ready to take back control of her life?",

Rheta says she's so fed up with their mother-and-son bond that she's filed for divorce, shredded her wedding vows and has even come to blows with Deb on several occasions. Mark agrees that his mother is too involved, but can he break ties while Deb holds the purse strings?

At the time, Morgan was down to a mere 80 pounds, her organs had begun to shut down, her extremities were blue, and they said they believed Morgan’s 20-year battle with anorexia was nearing a tragic end. With their plea for help answered, Morgan was scheduled to be a guest on Dr. Phil, but days before she was to appear on the show, she backed out, claiming she could “handle her own recovery.” Now 120 pounds, Morgan has put on weight but says that she is treating her eating disorder — and the anxiety she feels from gaining weight — with the help of prescription pills. She admits to sometimes taking as many as 20 Xanax in one day, and says she’s so desperate to end her pain that she’s put a gun to her head to end her life — four times. Morgan admits that she’s become an “exceptional liar” and has deceived her way through seven treatment facilities. Her parents say they feel helpless, and her father, Bob, admits that sometimes he wishes, “God would just take her.” Dr. Phil takes a close look into Morgan’s family dynamics. How may her parents be enabling her behavior and jeopardizing her recovery? If someone you love is battling an eating disorder, don’t miss this powerful Dr. Phil.",

She says he refuses to let her have a car, cell phone or friends and has not allowed her to leave the house in five months. She says they fight every day, and claims that during one brutal altercation, he punched her and fractured an eye socket, leaving her with a black eye for a month -- a claim he vehemently denies. Jesse says he’s not controlling, he’s just “containing the beast,” and that his wife needs to abide by his rules if she wants to stay married. He says he believes Mary got pregnant to trap him and the only reason he’s still with her is because of their three kids. Jesse says he discovered that Mary had an affair two years ago -- and now wonders if he’s even the father of their children. Mary says the affair was emotional, not sexual, and claims her husband’s treatment of her pushed her to do it.",

Now, Courtney says Sabby is smoking marijuana, having sex and has dropped out of school — behavior that Courtney says has also rubbed off on Sabby’s 14-year-old sister. Courtney pleads for Dr. Phil’s help once again — is it too late to get this out-of-control teen back on the right track? Then, Lisa says her 15-year-old son, Brandon, is a “raging lunatic” who smokes marijuana and has assaulted her, his stepfather, Tom, and other children — and she fears he’ll end up dead or seriously hurting someone.

The twins were born into a family of prestige and extreme wealth -- vacationing on the beaches of Fiji, having wild animals as pets and bringing diamonds to school for show-and-tell -- but say their lives have been anything but privileged. After their parents divorced and their father, Walker Inman Jr., won custody, they claim they lived each day in a state of pure terror -- burned with boiling water, forced to live in a feces-filled basement and held prisoner behind dead-bolted doors. How do they say they survived years of alleged torture? Their father, whom they claim abused drugs, died of an overdose in 2010, and the teens were reunited with their mother, Daisha Inman, with whom they now live.",

Emotions run high when the family comes together on Dr. Phil’s stage — and an unexpected moment happens. Will Brianna realize the dangers she’s facing and get the help she needs?",

She says she’s quick to become enraged, often screaming so loudly at Aaron that she loses her breath or blacks out — and she admits she once even punched him in the face while he was holding their baby. What’s at the root of her rage? And, why does Aaron — a former Marine who fought in the Iraq war — put up with this treatment? Plus, Ashley admits she also takes out her anger on her son by screaming in his face, and he’s now suffering from social and emotional issues. Dr. Phil sits the couple down in search of a resolution. Can Ashley learn to control her temper, for the sake of her children? And, can this marriage be saved?",

They claim she is abusive and violent --and they suspect she's only after his life insurance policy -- which Star vehemently denies. Star admits she has cheated on Kirk II twice but says she loves him and is tired of having his family point the finger at her. The family comes together on Dr. Phil’s stage -- marking the first time the parents have seen their son in several months. Kirk II says he is tired of being caught in the middle of the tug-of-war and thinks Star is worth fighting for -- does she feel the same about him? Can this marriage be fixed before it’s too late?",

Muhummed, a polygamist, trapped and terrorized his 13 children, three “wives” and their other children. He was finally arrested when one “wife”, Laura Cowan, snuck a letter to a postal worker who alerted the authorities. Now, Laura is a domestic abuse advocate. But several of Muhummed’s children argue that Laura has lied for years, publicizing a career in the media about being a victim, when they say she was partly responsible for their abuse! Laura has not seen Muhummed’s children in 16 years and wonders if they want a relationship with their half sibling, Tasslimah, who she claims was a product of rape while living in the house.",

While serving in Iraq, Courtney says she was blown from a 40-foot wall and suffered major injuries, which required reconstructive surgery. Courtney says that’s when she became addicted to pain pills. She says when her prescription ran out, she turned to something stronger and more easily obtainable — heroin. Courtney says she uses heroin to help treat her PTSD and to help numb the pain of enduring numerous sexual abuse-related traumas over the years. Bill claims that his ex-wife, Marlena, enables Courtney, and that’s why their daughter can’t stay clean. But Marlena says she can’t turn her back on Courtney, like Bill has — an accusation that Bill denies — and admits that she’s even driven Courtney to buy drugs.",

In the months leading to her arrest, Dawn claims she was the target of a vicious campaign to destroy everything she had built. She claims her tires were slashed, Craigslist ads were created offering free sex — resulting in men showing up at her salon — and sexually-explicit flyers super-imposed with her face and her two daughters, were strewn about her business and front lawn.

                    "overview": "Amber, aka “Jewel” Shuping, made international headlines when she intentionally made herself blind by putting drain cleaner into her eyes. Jewel says that ever since she was a little girl, she dreamed of being blind, claiming to live with “Body Integrity Identity Disorder,” a disorder which causes an otherwise healthy person to feel that he or she is meant to be disabled. Jewel says she hated opening her eyes every day, and as a teen, oftentimes pretended to be blind, even walking with a white cane for as long as two weeks straight. She says that living with sight, to her, felt like living in a personal prison. She claims that seven years ago, she traveled 19 hours by train to visit a “sympathetic” psychologist whom she met online, and allowed him to pour liquid drain cleaner into both of her eyes. In a Dr. Phil daytime exclusive, hear why Jewel says she felt she had no choice but to take her vision, and hear the bombshell claim she drops about removing one of her eyes!",

And, she and their children, Kristina and Eric, desperately hope Michael will toss out the postnup — whether they stay together or not.

She claims that Laura neglected to teach her any life skills and encouraged her to drop out of high school in the eleventh grade and that John was more of a friend than a parent, who drank alcohol and used drugs with her and her teenage friends. John admits he was the “party dad,” who even hosted parties at his house, but says he used drugs and alcohol as a way to bond with Lauren. But is this just the tip of the iceberg? Lauren also claims that her dad had multiple affairs – including one with her mom’s best friend – and that her mom stole her identity and racked up $50,000 in debt – a claim Laura denies. Then, Dr. Phil drops the bombshell that John spent nearly two years behind bars and was dubbed the “Breast Pump Bandit” by his city’s local news, for stealing thousands of dollars’ worth of breast pumps and selling them online.",

After five hospitalizations, countless therapists and a myriad of prescribed medications, Jennifer says she feels like she is out of options. Dr. Phil takes a look at some family home videos — and calls some parenting techniques into question. What could be at the root of the boy's bad behavior? And, Jennifer’s son opens up about what life is like in his family. What, if anything, might Jennifer do differently? And, how can they calm the chaos and get this teen on the right path?",

Simpson: American Crime Story,” inspired by the book, The Run of His Life: The People V. O.J. Simpson, by CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin. While the miniseries has gotten much positive publicity, members of the Goldman and the Brown families say they are upset their family member’s death was turned into an entertainment TV show. Ron Goldman’s father, Fred, says he wonders why he and his daughter, Kim, were never contacted by producers and if this series will be nothing but sensationalized fiction.

At trial, Andrew's foster mother, Hannah, who the media dubbed “Salt Mom,” was found guilty of killing Andrew with a lethal dose of salt, and she was sentenced to life in prison. But the story doesn’t end there. After serving seven years, Hannah’s conviction was reversed by the Court of Criminal Appeals for Ineffective Assistance of Counsel, and ultimately the charges against her were dismissed. Now free and back home with her husband and children, questions remain about the day Andrew died, the manner of his death and what prosecutors claimed was evidence of abuse and neglect.",

But now, Karen says she is in danger and that some people are trying to ruin her reputation. She says that they are tracking her every move through a microchip implanted in her eyebrow, and they are hacking her computers and cell phone. Because she lost everything, Karen moved in with her brother John and his wife, Ronda. Now, she says she’s witnessed some suspicious activity in their home causing Karen to question if her brother is the one behind all her troubles. John denies Karen’s allegations and says he believes her paranoia stems from drug use. Is Karen’s brother really having her followed, or is something else going on with Karen? Karen agrees to take a drug test. Find out what the results reveal.",

For the first time since she says she left her life of sex trafficking three years ago, Kendall tells her story and explains why she is still petrified that the boss of this operation, whom she calls “the man who owns her,” will find her and bring her back.",

Amy says in a desperate attempt to help her adoptive son, she tracked down Nick’s biological mother, Lupita, who Nick hadn’t seen in 10 years since losing her rights to him, to see if maybe Lupita could help. Amy claims that has backfired terribly and says Lupita is out to sabotage her relationship with Nick and turn him against her family.

Now, she says she has a “stalker living in her home.” She claims Ronnie has broken into her phone, sabotaged her relationships, won’t stop staring at her and watches her while she sleeps, eats and watches TV – she claims things are so bad, she won’t make eye contact with him because she fears he’ll take it the wrong way. Ronnie says he’s not obsessed. He says everything he does for Crystal is out of love and “nine out of 10 women would kill for a man like him.” He wants Crystal to admit her feelings for him and acknowledge they are a family. Ronnie’s 16-year-old son, Shawn, says his father is so “crazy and obsessed” with Crystal, and he acts out in school and gets bad grades in hopes his father will pay attention to him instead of her. Will Crystal admit her true feelings for Ronnie? Or does Ronnie believe his behavior has gone too far?",

Alaska’s husband, Paul says, at first, he thought it was a great idea but now, he isn’t so sure. Paul claims things went downhill when Alaska started using provocative photos of herself to “market” the site, and when he also discovered she had a secret profile on the site and that men were offering her thousands of dollars. Alaska says she’s ready to come clean with Paul. Is she doing more than just “cuddling” with her clients? And, see what caused Alaska to become so enraged that she couldn’t stop talking about it even after she left the stage. Plus, what does Dr. Phil say about the future of their marriage?",

The actor is once again in the news with his new autobiography, Buseyisms: Gary Busey’s Basic Instructions Before Leaving Earth, where he shares his ups and downs of almost 50 years in Hollywood and surviving a drug overdose. In his book, Busey talks about how a man who called himself the “Devil” showed up at his door with a box and that led to his addiction. Find out what was in that little blue box. Plus, meet Busey’s doctor and find out what he says he discovered when he did a SPECT scan of the famous actor’s brain. Can this discovery explain Busey’s publicized erratic behavior?",

Later, hear from Dawson’s aunt Abbie, who says her minivan was trashed after Dawson went joyriding in it at 110 miles per hour. Not convinced Dawson really understood what his future could look like if he kept idealizing this criminal lifestyle, Dr. Phil presented a group of people to explain the consequences of dangerous behavior, including a former gang member and a woman currently paralyzed as the result of a reckless car accident.",

His body had been wrapped in a carpet and kept in a cold, dark storage unit, mummifying for nearly two years. But his family didn’t suspect a thing and never reported him missing. That’s because Shannon’s family believes not only did his then-wife, Toni, shoot Shannon in the back of the head, but they claim she then tricked everyone into believing he was still alive by impersonating him via email and text. Shannon’s son, Lance, says he hasn’t been the same since learning of his father's death and is still completely obsessed with the case. Lance says he is riddled with guilt and believes his choice to join the Navy was the literal nail in his father’s coffin. His mother, Melanie, says Lance just needs to move on, but Lance says that’s not possible until he figures out why on earth his stepmother murdered his father. You don’t want to miss this one!",

People who never thought they had a drinking problem are drinking more and are starting to wonder if they might develop a problem. Today, Dr. Phil talks to Anne, a woman who says that she and her boyfriend broke up a few days after they began self-isolating and shares that she's been drinking alcohol to help heal her broken heart. Also, two former guests, Danielle and Niki, join Dr. Phil to share the struggles they've seen firsthand in the sober community during the pandemic.",

Cassie says her fears include red stop lights, choking, lotions, salt on French fries, caffeine, makeup, and so much more. Cassie says she spends most of her restless nights researching her ailments on the internet, and search engines have become her “best friend.” Cassie says she’s convinced she has some underlying heart issue, OCD, and possibly some type of cancer that they have yet to diagnose. Cassie’s fiancé, Joe, says her issues have had a definite impact on their relationship and says he fears he may be enabling her.

But, Karen’s daughter, Mindy, says there is no “Thomas.” She says she is sure her mother is being catfished by a man she has never met or even video chatted with, who claims to be on an oil rig and stuck in the Gulf of Mexico. Mindy says her mother’s heart is not the only thing “Thomas” has stolen from her; he has also gone after money her recently retired mother doesn’t have to give. Karen says she is a dedicated Dr. Phil viewer and has watched all his shows on catfishing, so she knows her “lover” is real. She claims the fact that no one can prove he is a fake gives her great hope they will be together soon. Find out what happens when Dr. Phil provides Karen with evidence that she is being scammed. Will she believe the truth?",

Tamera says the four-time Grammy winner entered her body soon after her death in 2012. Ever since, she claims she’s had visions of Etta James’ life and says she is now ready to restart her music career and show the world that Etta James is back! But Tamera’s mother, Debra, and Tamera’s twin sister, Tia, claim Tamera is “delusional” and not in any way Etta James. They say they absolutely refuse to call Tamera “Etta,” which they say has led to the family completely fracturing. Later, Bishop T.D. Jakes, founder of The Potter’s House Church, a non-denominational, multicultural church in Dallas, Texas, joins Dr. Phil to discuss the way we speak and why words matter. Bishop Jakes is also a New York Times bestselling author whose latest book, Don’t Drop the Mic: The Power of Words Can Change the World, is in bookstores and online now.",

Lastly, Dr. Phil headed to Colorado where he met a family who say they were thrown into chaos at their family-owned business due to what they claim is their stepfather, Mark’s, narcissistic behavior.",

If you’re wishing you were married, thinking about getting married, or are married, you won’t want to miss this episode. After 21 years of marriage, Paula says she’s thinking about divorcing her husband, Jeremy, because, in her words, he’s “clueless, absent, and non-verbal.” But Jeremy says the real problem is Paula. He says not only is Paula controlling, but she’s a grudge-holder, too, and won’t move on from a mistake he made almost 10 years ago. Find out the mistake Jeremy made, and Dr. Phil gets to the bottom of why Paula is so controlling. Plus, Dr. Phil and Robin share the secret to their 45-year marriage.",

One, a man gunned down in cold blood, and the other, a teenage girl named Kiera, who was convicted of his murder and sentenced to 60 years to life in prison. After serving over 19 years in prison, Kiera was released early and has continued to claim she is innocent and was falsely incarcerated. Today, Dr. Phil exams Kiera’s case and speaks with her lawyers, who call Kiera’s conviction “the starkest miscarriage of justice” they have ever seen. Dr. Phil looks at all the evidence Kiera and her attorneys claim is proof that she had nothing to do with this horrendous crime. Plus, hear from Kiera’s high school teacher who testified that Kiera was in her classroom at the very same time the murder took place. But that’s not all, also hear from a key witness for the prosecution -- has he now changed his story?",

Pro-life supporters cheered on the ruling, while pro-choice supporters pledged to fight it. Now, in a post-Roe America, women are caught at the center of legal confusion because of these often-vague state laws. Nancy Davis says she was about 10 weeks pregnant when the fetus she was carrying was diagnosed with acrania, a fatal condition where the fetus’ skull does not form inside the womb. She claims she tried to have an abortion, but doctors denied her, because in her home state of Louisiana, abortions are banned. In an exclusive interview with Dr. Phil, Nancy and her partner, Shedric, reveal what she had to do to get a legal abortion. Nancy’s story is at the center of one of the decade's most controversial and heated debates: abortion. Today, hear from both pro-choice and pro-life advocates.",

However, some Department Of Justice experts say they believe the number is closer to 250,000 per year. Dr. Phil speaks with parents, Gabriel and Nerissa, their daughter, Patricia, and their attorney, Sandy Roxas, who explain why they feel anti-Asian hate is often overlooked. The close-knit family says they are traumatized after a recent incident at a fast-food drive-thru involving a stranger who mocked them using a fake Asian accent.",

Find out what he says happened in the attack that made national news and landed Joey in the hospital. Then, Rabbi Aryeh Cohen shares some insight as to why hate crimes against Jewish people are sometimes ignored. Plus, meet a former white supremacist, Christian, who explains the psychology behind people who commit acts of violence due to extreme feelings of hate. And, Becky Monroe, Deputy Director of Strategic Initiatives and External Affairs for California, shares insightful information after tracking hate crimes across America, and law enforcement analyst Mark Powell explains why police officers do not immediately assume an incident is a hate crime, even with video evidence.",

This plan offers targeted debt relief as part of a comprehensive effort to address the burden of growing college costs and make the student loan system more manageable for working families. The Education Department has indicated that around 8 million federal student loan borrowers who already have their income information on file with the Department will be eligible for automatic student loan forgiveness. However, this announcement kicked off a nationwide debate. Supporters praised the act as a landmark move to wipe out millions of student loan debt, while critics say the plan will increase inflation and does not address the underlying problem of soaring higher-education costs.

Bailey claims she was sexually assaulted by three basketball players but claims they were protected by the university.

Not only are counterfeit prescription pills routinely laced with Fentanyl, but so are street drugs like cocaine and marijuana, which is killing people in masses. Feliz shares the tragic story of losing her sister, Karina, to a mass fentanyl poisoning that killed her and four other adults. Also, John, a father, says he watched both his sons overdose in his home after taking what they thought was Oxycodone but instead was a counterfeit pill laced with fentanyl. One of his sons survived and shares what happened on that fatal night.",

Does that sound ridiculous? Quiet quitting, the idea that employees only do what is in their job description, between the hours they were hired to do it, and nothing more has become more than a viral social media hashtag; it has become a movement by employees of all ages. Dr. Phil speaks with an employment and labor attorney who says quiet quitting makes perfect sense, because if employers want employees to work extra, then they need to pay them extra. Then, hear from a young man who says he is currently quiet quitting. Why does he say he won’t put in extra effort without being paid for it? Plus, business owners say quiet quitters are just a bunch of slackers, undependable employees hiding behind a cute hashtag to make lazy sound better.",

Should children never wear Halloween costumes that depict another culture, ethnicity or race? When does admiration turn into appropriation, and is the argument against appropriation just? Does the anti-appropriation movement ever turn into a form of racism? Meet a young woman who says she received death threats for wearing a dress from another culture, a woman who says she was called out for cosplaying a Japanese anime character, and a woman who says people need to stop stealing other cultures' foods and calling them their own.",

Are laws that ban transgender women from participating in women's sports fair? LGBTQ+ activists have described criteria limiting transgender athlete involvement in gendered sports as \"discriminatory.” Lia Thomas made headline news and stirred debate when she competed in swimming nationals as a transgender woman. Dr. Phil, along with Layne Ingram, a transgender man and basketball coach, and Olympic swimmer Nancy Hogshead-Makar, an advocate for girls and women in sports and CEO of Champion Women, discuss what they believe is right and fair. Then, Riley Gaines, who competed against Lia Thomas, gives her perspective on how she felt after their race. The big question is: what does the science say? Harvard professor Dr. Carole Hooven breaks it down.",

Los Angeles resident Marcy Jo agrees and says open drug use and homelessness in L.A. have gotten out of control. On the other side of the debate is California State Senator Scott Wiener, who wrote Senate Bill 57. The bill would have legalized safe consumption sites in San Francisco, Oakland, Los Angeles and Los Angeles County, but was vetoed by Governor Newsom in August 2022.

At the time, medical aid-in-dying was only authorized in four states, but today, it has been legalized in 10 states and Washington D.C.

Since 2019, the hashtag #okboomer has been used 3.7 B times on TikTok to describe a Baby Boomer being “out of touch.” Is Gen Z really being coddled, whereas Boomers “pulled themselves up by their bootstraps”?

And if a bullied teen does disconnect their devices, bullies can always use old-fashioned, in-person harassment. It seems there's no escape. Meet Antoinette, whose 13-year-old daughter, Muffin, took her own life after being bullied by children at her school. When not in school, Antoinette says they continued the bullying online, creating fake online pages and talking about Muffin’s appearance.

Bullying is a severe threat to a child’s self-esteem and mental health. Being targeted by a cyberbully can increase the risk of anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, feelings of worthlessness, and, most tragically, suicide. But not all bullying is long-term. In fact, the heavy psychological toll this kind of harassment takes can often be swift. Meet Cheryl and Hunter, whose 16-year-old daughter, McKenna, took her own life after being bullied by four girls she thought were her friends. They say that after less than five days of being bullied, McKenna could no longer cope and made the tragic decision to take her own life. The parents say their daughter went to shower on a Saturday evening, and they never saw her alive again.",

Advocates say this law protects the rights of the parent. But critics nicknamed the law “Don’t Say Gay” and claim it turns back the clock on equality. Tiffany Justice and Tina Descovich, co-founders of Moms of Liberty, say every parent deserves a seat at the table to make sure that certain inappropriate content is not discussed. Candice Jackson, an attorney and mother who worked for the Department of Education under President Trump, says it’s our First Amendment right not to call someone by their preferred pronouns. However, Nadine Smith, executive director for Equality for Florida, says children need full transparency in their curriculum.",

The number of Americans using marijuana is at a record high, so it appears that using pot is getting a pass! But, many experts and concerned citizens insist marijuana is dangerous and that it should not be legal. Dr. Phil mediates a heated discussion between people on both sides of this issue, including retired police officer Major Neill Franklin, marijuana policy maker Karen O’Keefe, and dispensary insiders Bre and Char, who insist legalization is keeping children and communities safe. On the other side are anti-legalization activist Dr. Kevin Sabet, as well as ER physician Dr. Roneet Lev, who claims to see the effects of marijuana in her hospital every day. Plus, Laura Stack claims she lost her teenage son due to the legalization of marijuana.",

Dr. Phil speaks with pro-choice advocate and President of the National Organization for Women, Christian Nunes, and Lila Rose, pro-life activist and president/founder of Live Action, a non-profit anti-abortion organization.",

However, she says one date, who appeared to be jealous, stole her keys and hid under her bed to spy on her. Holden says he went to his date’s father’s house to play video games but ended up waking up in a bathtub and barely making it out alive. Christine says after her divorce, she thought she met her Prince Charming on a dating app, but he ended up scamming her out of a lot of money. Kelly says she met a man at a bar for her first date, and before she could say bye, he grabbed her, threw her in his car, and sexually assaulted her.",

They claim women who have a problem with it are from an older generation with an even older sense of fashion and style. Nicole, a social media fashion influencer and wardrobe stylist, says showing more skin is all about female empowerment. Radio show host Andrea Kaye and Kent State University Associate Professor Dr. Suzy D’Enbeau weigh in, explaining why they disagree and believe dressing in a revealing way is not actually empowering to women at all.

Other states are pushing universities to expedite teacher certifications, and some districts are hiring student teachers who are still enrolled in college to be full-time first-year teachers. Dr. Phil and his panel of guests also discuss possible solutions to the country’s falling student performance in math, science and reading according to OECD’s PISA 2018 international world ranking of developed nations.",

People feel more angry, isolated, and victimized than at any time in recent history, and politicians seem to be using a war of words that just keep stoking the fire. America’s best-known and most respected political strategist and pollster, Dr. Frank Luntz, joins Dr. Phil to show us the words to use and which to lose when it comes to having a conversation with someone who doesn’t share your beliefs.",

They don’t care about the repercussions the person may face after their behavior has been exposed. Others believe recording strangers in public is more about getting attention on social media and that even in public, people should have a semblance of privacy. Dr. Phil meets Jasmine, who claims she recorded and posted a video of a confrontation she had with an angry woman at a restaurant to get justice and force accountability. The woman in Jasmine’s video was identified online by a man known as ThatDaneshGuy, who says identifying people in these videos is a way to help people get justice -- but does it do more harm than good?",

Dr. Phil meets several women who claim doctors didn’t take them seriously, which led to major health problems. Philecia was 29 when she says her life came crashing down after an undiagnosed lump turned into stage 4 breast cancer. Then, a woman says she saw 30 different doctors within five years for migraines before she finally got a diagnosis. And, how did a 27-year-old woman go from a competitive runner to using a wheelchair and needing open heart surgery?

Clusters of tent cities line almost every block. Beach paths, parks, underpasses and street dividers look like “Skid Row.” California’s problem is reflective of a growing national crisis, and now, major cities across the U.S. are taking aim at the issue by passing new laws that restrict where the homeless can camp. But, these new measures are sparking a heated debate. Dr. Phil is joined by a councilman who claims he has the solutions, as well as the Executive Director of the National Coalition for the Homeless. Plus, go inside some of Los Angeles’ most dangerous encampments, and hear from a homeless woman who says there is hope.",

Parenthood has increasingly become a topic of conversation as more and more people are deciding not to have children. All across social media, people are celebrating “child-free” living and some think the human population should just become extinct altogether. There is a fierce and controversial argument about the environmental, economic, and racial concerns of having or not having children. Will having children make the world a better place? Dr. Phil discusses whether it’s “smart” to procreate with pronatalists, those who encourage people to have children, and anti-natalists, those who believe it is morally/ethically wrong or unjustifiable for people to have children. Plus, Dr. John Whyte, Chief Medical Officer at WebMD, shares how to take control of your diabetes risk. Dr. Whyte says every year, 1.5 million people are diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, and this is a serious issue. Tune in today.",

But what has struck some experts is how blatant the comments about Jews are at a time when incidents of harassment, vandalism, and violence have been at their highest levels since at least the 1970s. Recently, Jewish community centers throughout Detroit and synagogues in New Jersey were evacuated due to bomb threats, and in Sacramento, the sign in front of a synagogue was set on fire and desecrated with swastikas. Dr. Phil is joined by a panel of guests to discuss recent incidents of antisemitism and solutions.",

In a video that went viral and made news headlines, she says that when her grandfather passed away in 2020, she inherited his home and felt pressured into selling after being bombarded with letters offering to buy the property. Why does she say she fears racial discrimination will affect the actual value of her property? James and Misty say they’ve filed a federal discrimination lawsuit after a local real estate agent allegedly rejected their intention to buy condos based on their race. However, the accused agent denies she racially discriminated against them. Find out what James and Misty’s civil rights attorney and advocate for social justice, Justin Moore, says about his clients’ case. And, meet Chris Murray, an attorney who represented a client wrongfully accused of racial discrimination via “steering.”",

For the past 36 years, Patty has been serving a life sentence after being convicted of murdering her high school sweetheart husband, Bill. However, Patty has always maintained her innocence. The only recourse for Patty now is for Missouri Governor Mike Parson to exercise his constitutional power to grant her clemency. Dr. Phil discusses Prewitt's case with Patty’s oldest daughter, Jane, Patty’s friend Mary, and Patty herself from prison. Patty’s attorney, Brian Reichart, tells Dr. Phil why he believes Patty deserves to be with her family. And, two state Representatives from Missouri, Shamed Dogan (R) and Tracy McCreery (D), have spearheaded a group of bipartisan lawmakers to sign a letter to the Governor begging for mercy.",

The film follows “Race2Dinner” co-founders and co-authors of 'White Women: Everything You Already Know About Your Own Racism and How To Do Better,\" Regina Jackson and Saira Rao, who say they challenge white women who say they are not racist to see their innate racism and use the newfound realization to help fight systemic racism in America.",

Unfortunately, teachers are now underpaid, overworked, and looking for supplemental income because of today’s economy. More than half of all K-12 teachers in the United States earn income from sources other than their teaching salary. There is a growing trend that allows teachers to make their yearly income in just one month: sex work on subscription social platforms. For some teachers, this has allowed them to live a new “American dream.” Why is it acceptable for teachers to work side jobs in retail – and not through sex work? While activists are currently working to combat sex work stigma, critics believe teachers have a moral obligation to their students. Dr. Phil and his guests discuss a subject once thought of as “taboo” but is now in the headlines for how teachers make ends meet.",

Dr. Dimitri Christakis, Director of the Center for Child Health, Behavior and Development at Seattle Children's Research Institute, shares shocking results of learning loss and the impact of school closures and distance learning. Plus, what early assumptions were made during the pandemic that may have been incorrect? Former CDC director Robert Redfield explains what he believes were mistakes early on during the COVID-19 pandemic. And, is the pandemic over?

Kimberly, a University of Tennessee doctoral candidate, claims her college violated her freedom of speech after a professional conduct committee determined that she had posted unprofessional content to her social media. What rights do colleges have to spy on personal social media posts? Also, Tehran Von Ghasri, a comedian who performs on college campuses, says cancel culture has gone too far. How does the fear of being canceled affect the jokes he performs for college students or content he posts online? Alexandra, a social media influencer and business owner, says giving opinions about COVID got her censored and three accounts closed. What did she say to get canceled?",

The popularity of online challenges is rising and unfortunately, have become extremely unsafe -- and in some cases, deadly. “The Blackout Challenge,” which encourages children to strangle or suffocate themselves until they blackout, is arguably the most dangerous. It originated as “the choking game,” even as early as the 1930s. Prior to 2007, the CDC reported it resulted in the deaths of 82 children, with most victims being adolescent males ages 11-16, with the average age being 13. Since then, it has resurfaced on social platforms and in 2021, caused the death of roughly 10 children in the U.S. Dr. Phil meets two families who lost their sons to \"The blackout challenge.\" He also receives an update from a past guest who lost one of her 13-year-old twin boys to \"the choking game\" in 2005.",

Many say the sentiment was right but the slogan was misleading. Now, more than two years later, hear from citizens who say it has been a dangerous debacle that has led to unprecedented levels of crime and violence in their cities because law enforcement budgets were cut or diverted. However, others insist that’s not true – they claim it's just a national misinformation campaign to divert attention from the real issues in their communities that not only need police protection but also protection from those charged with guarding their safety and security. So which is it? Dr. Phil has a passionate discussion with experts on both sides of the issue. It’s an episode you don’t want to miss.",

Santiago says the system is broken and he is fearful his son will be killed or end up dead unless he suffers some sort of consequence for his actions. Ashley says she has the opposite problem with the system; she claims her son is locked up for minor things, such as behavioral issues, which aren’t crimes. Michelle claims the system has failed her as a parent because the law never helped with her son when he was a minor, and now that he is 18, he gets locked up.",

Rumors swirled that Alex Murdaugh and his family could get away with anything. They have been tied to the mysterious deaths of their housekeeper, a high school classmate, and a young woman in a fatal boat crash. In June 2021, Murdaugh allegedly found his wife and younger son shot dead on their hunting lodge property. About a year later, Murdaugh was charged for their murders. The killings set off a bizarre chain of events that included Murdaugh staging his own murder. There are also nearly 100 criminal charges that are linked to him. Dr. Phil is joined by a panel of experts: former criminal prosecutor Loni Coombs; Michal Higdon, anchor and investigative reporter at WCSC-TV Charleston; forensic expert Joseph Scott Morgan; and former FBI agent Bobby Chacon to discuss this case.",

Porizkova tells Dr. Phil that women need to embrace their wrinkles and their age. Sixty-year-old Tami says she’s so self-conscious about her age she sometimes won’t leave the house. Thirty-three-year-old Fifi says she’s consumed by her fear of aging. And, 54-year-old Terry says between her throat wattle, age spots, wrinkles, and bifocals, it’s impossible to look in the mirror and feel good. Plus, meet mother/daughter duo Elisa and Lily who are the co-founders of Stylelikeu, a website focused on self-acceptance.

James says he meets women online, and when they are on their way to meet, the women are kidnapped and transported to an undisclosed camp. Then, he says a gang leader from the camp contacts him, and he saves these women by sending gift cards to free them – because the gangs only accept gift cards. Dr. Phil talks to James about these alleged online models, specifically “Ava,” who James says he invited to the taping, and “Maria,” who James says he recently saved from a camp. Is James saving models? Or, is his kindness being taken advantage of and he is being scammed for money? And, does the woman in the photos of “Ava” show up to meet Dr. Phil? Find out.",

Matthew, who admits to having arguments with Darren and allowing his dogs to defecate in Darren’s yard, says Darren is making the iguana problem worse. How does Darren respond to his neighbor?

In the summer of 1994, 17-year-old Atif was home from Cornell University, hanging out with his high school best friend, Sebastian Burns. On July 12, when they returned home sometime after 2 a.m., they say they walked into a brutal scene. Atif’s parents and sister had all been bludgeoned to death. Atif, now 46, has been sitting in prison for 28 years serving three life sentences. Speaking to Dr. Phil from prison, Atif says two undercover cops posed as mobsters and lured the young men into thinking that they would be killed if Atif didn’t confess to murdering his family. Dr. Phil dissects Atif’s confession with his appellate attorney Daniel Woofter; attorney Laura Nirider, co-director of the Center on Wrongful Conviction; Dave Thompson, expert in interrogation training and certified forensic interviewer; and Innocence Project board member Jason Flom.",

It is said you can’t love others until you love yourself first -- but is saying “I do” to yourself going too far? Critics of sologamy say “self-marriage” is narcissistic and makes a mockery of this special sacrament. Dr. Phil meets 30-year-old Danni, who says she spent $4,000 on her self-wedding; life coach and expert Sasha Cagen, who married herself at 40 and guides other women to marry themselves, and says she spent $100 on her self-wedding; and 50-year-old Sonya, who says she spent $15,000. Then, hear from John McEntee, Founder and CEO of “The Right Stuff,” who says sologamy is selfish and marriage should be viewed as a sacred sacrament.",

The family was known for their position, power, and prestige. However, since 2015, personal injury attorney Alex Murdaugh and his family have been linked to a series of investigations for deaths, corruption, insurance fraud, defrauding clients, and now, murder. Recently, 54-year-old Alex was indicted on two counts of murder and two counts of possession of a weapon during the commission of a violent crime for the 2021 killings of his wife, Maggie, and youngest son, Paul. Dr. Phil and his panel of experts discuss key points and evidence from the trial, which began on January 23, 2023. See police bodycam footage of Alex at the crime scene, including his interview with police in the cop car. And, the experts analyze Alex’s behavior on the night of the murders.",

So, chances are if this topic doesn’t affect you, it is affecting someone you know. The legalization of sports betting has raised concerns about gambling addictions – and if sports fans are taking their “love of the game” too far by online gambling. Dr. Phil talks with Charles, a self-admitted gambling addict, who says he hasn’t gambled in two months but fears he could again. Dr. Phil also hears from Trell, a sports gambling influencer, and Sean Green, co-host of “The Sports Gambling Podcast,” on what they claim are “pros” of sports gambling. Then, Gary says he was a compulsive gambler from age 18-40 and now advocates against sports gambling.",

In December 2022, the Drug Enforcement Agency warned that over prescription of ADHD medication could be as bad as the opioid crisis. Is medicating children for ADHD a troubling trend or an appropriate response? Megan says her 7-year-old son has always been a handful, and when she finally made an appointment to discuss this with his physician last summer, the recommendation was medication. Hear why she says she’s worried and blames herself for his behavior. Then, Cassie and Carl say their 3-year-old twin boys were acting so wildly during an evaluation that their doctor said she hadn’t seen a case of ADHD so bad in a long time. Now that the boys are medicated, what does Cassie say is her biggest worry?",

                    "overview": "The number of young people who identify as transgender has nearly doubled in recent years. Some people say this is because the transgender community is more embraced, but others say teens are rushing to get medical treatments without counseling or knowing the facts. In some extreme cases, this can even lead to what’s called “detransition.” As a teen, Ryan transitioned from a female to a male but says she then realized she made an epic mistake, reversed her decision, and detransitioned to be female again. Over 20 years ago, Kara had medical treatments and later gender reassignment surgery and says policy has greatly changed. She says it's concerning that today, there are far less requirements for children seeking puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and surgery. However, Reece says he knew he was male as a small child, and these medical treatments saved his life as a teen. He says denying teens the right to these procedures is “trans genocide.”",

All three families are pushing for change and more conversations about mental health on campus.

Others contend criminal justice reforms are needed to fix a broken and unjust criminal justice system. Dr. Phil has a powerful discussion with people on both sides of this issue.

Wendell claims she has the same famous dark mark on her eye as McCann and similar body markings. She also claims she can’t remember large chunks of her early childhood, isn’t sure of her age, and has never seen her birth certificate. In an exclusive interview, Wendell reveals what else she discovered that made her believe she is the girl who vanished in 2007 at 3 years old. However, Wendell’s parents in Poland insist she is their biological child and deny she was kidnapped. McCann, who would be 19 years old now, was abducted in 2007 while on vacation with her family in Portugal and is presumed dead. Has McCann finally been found? Or, is this a cruel hoax?",

Was the stress of her highly productive lifestyle the cause of her recent heart attack? Emily's best friend, Jeff, joins the conversation because he says he is worried Emily may suffer another heart attack if she doesn't de-stress her life. Then, parents Meghan and Tyler discuss how Tyler's cardiac issues arose after the tragic death of their 5-year-old son. Find out if his grief and sadness may have caused his heart to literally “break.” Lastly, Dr. Phil speaks with Dr. John Whyte about his new book, \"Take Control of Your Heart Disease Risk,\" which tackles how mental health and the heart are inextricably linked.",

Sisters Ashley, Ebony, and Fallon say their lives were turned upside down when their younger brother, Jerome, was, according to them, falsely convicted of murder. Now, they say they can’t figure out how to move forward. Then, Ian and Colleen say they are stuck after Ian was dubbed a hero for intervening in a shooting that tragically ended with one man losing his life. Ian says he has been struggling with feelings of guilt, grief, and frustration ever since, and that they have haunted even his happiest moments. And, Nancy says she thought she had dealt with her past sexual abuse and trauma but that it all came flooding back when she read a news article and saw that the person who she claims abused her was arrested for abusing other children – something she says she feels immense guilt over and even questions if she should be held responsible.",
