So when he wakes up on his birthday to discover that somehow time has reset itself, he can't believe he must relive every miserable moment of the past 12 months once more. Until his friends Simon Birch and Maddy Kent convince him he's being offered a second chance and maybe this time round, he can get it right.","popularity":4.274,"poster_path":"/nclPPFPnTGu1tbnQXoAVXd0HOz6.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3426,"logo_path":"/w2uXMoK1hHemYFvEEpoDJgskIRQ.png","name":"The Australian Children's Television Foundation","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2014-04-26","episode_count":13,"id":85301,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"58ab5452c3a36849fe0013b3","air_date":"2014-04-26","episodes":[{"air_date":"2014-04-26","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1274400,"name":"Happy Birthday","overview":"Alex King wakes up on the morning of his 15th birthday to discover that time has reset itself and he must relive the worst year of his life all over again.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":70353,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-05-03","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1274401,"name":"Valentine's Day","overview":"Valentine's Day is Alex's perfect opportunity to woo the girl of his dreams, but his declaration of love ends up in the wrong hands.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":70353,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-05-10","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1274402,"name":"Beach","overview":"It's fund-raising day at the life-saving club, and Alex gets on the wrong side of his nemesis Mr Norris, as Gibbo and The Gal from EZ1-FM kick-off a treasure hunt.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":70353,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-05-17","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":1274403,"name":"April Fool","overview":"Alex intends to use his 'loop year' to turn the tables on Simon, who has used him as his April Fool target each year.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":70353,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-05-24","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":1274404,"name":"Sam's Party","overview":"When Alex and his sister Sam are left home alone for the night, they decide they should host a house party - with disastrous consequences.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":70353,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-05-31","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":1274405,"name":"Maths Test","overview":"Alex arrives late to Mr Norris's maths lesson, resulting in Mr Norris giving the whole class a maths test.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":70353,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-06-04","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":1274406,"name":"Match Day","overview":"It's the grand final for Alex's soccer team the Mad Dogs, but after he causes a major mix up in a sports store, it's up to Alex's soccer-mad Dad to step in and save the day.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":70353,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-06-05","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"standard","id":1274407,"name":"Cross Country","overview":"Alex is determined to win the boys' cross country race, even if he has to cheat.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":70353,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-06-09","episode_number":9,"episode_type":"standard","id":1274408,"name":"School Play","overview":"Alex is thrilled when he gets the chance to play Romeo opposite Nicola's Juliet in the school play.
