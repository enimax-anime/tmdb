His distraught mother, Marjorie is not upset that her favorite son is gay, but that he wants to leave Boston and his family. Ronny's plans change, however, when his politically incorrect and outspoken father, Arthur stuns everyone with his choice for an assistant. Touched by his father's offer, Ronny embarks on a completely different future and he can be sure that his loving family, including his twin brothers Sean and Gerard and his sister Jackie, are going to have a very vocal opinion about it.","popularity":4.444,"poster_path":"/wOXQ2DrJkQ48PMjuPOrR5LmqMYU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11073,"logo_path":"/aCbASRcI1MI7DXjPbSW9Fcv9uGR.png","name":"Sony Pictures Television Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":7291,"logo_path":"/eo8YnSO7wpUHVEprnMDOUcalhFD.png","name":"Olive Bridge Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1081,"logo_path":"/19kn4jVvpc3sAL3YpZNb3elhSMl.png","name":"CBS Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2014-10-30","episode_count":15,"id":63305,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":3}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":7,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"54539a320e0a2648cf0014e8","air_date":"2014-10-30","episodes":[{"air_date":"2014-10-30","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1014453,"name":"Pilot","overview":"When Ronny considers moving away from his close-knit, sports-crazed family, his father surprises everyone when he offers him a job as his assistant basketball coach.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":61563,"still_path":"/wTKLWClofPigkljr2X3XZoxFJEJ.jpg","vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"54539c76c3a3681484001566","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1380058,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brian Gallivan","original_name":"Brian Gallivan","popularity":1.473,"profile_path":"/gYLfkuxVtOw6dlu3XdPgR6d3BVp.jpg"},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"54539c820e0a2648c5001594","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213790,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andy Ackerman","original_name":"Andy Ackerman","popularity":4.098,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Costume Design","department":"Costume & Make-Up","credit_id":"5aa53c6dc3a3687c06020306","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1995941,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Keri Smith","original_name":"Keri Smith","popularity":1.05,"profile_path":"/3kU2ZqlEgirseKdkgcrNDmd4iS5.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Coach Colwell","credit_id":"54539c0b0e0a2648cb001573","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18328,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Howard","original_name":"Ken Howard","popularity":8.419,"profile_path":"/3c5FhIv5aTcDqlt5rUNF9lz9Zc4.jpg"},{"character":"Priest","credit_id":"54539c140e0a2648c500158c","order":501,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":203762,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miguel Nájera","original_name":"Miguel Nájera","popularity":2.942,"profile_path":"/iyzgMgk540UJjHx9d4fsuVTqC8F.jpg"},{"character":"Phillip","credit_id":"54539c20c3a368148d001550","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":143236,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeff Hiller","original_name":"Jeff Hiller","popularity":6.596,"profile_path":"/AoIQ8ZRtxMIQatnhFeJHG6q6AVf.jpg"},{"character":"Basketball Coordinator","credit_id":"54539c2fc3a368148d001552","order":503,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20814,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gregory Smith","original_name":"Gregory Smith","popularity":16.857,"profile_path":"/5qwhNXC5SZf3D7e1i6iNFvcp91P.jpg"},{"character":"Hot Female Mourner","credit_id":"54539c3ec3a368147c001497","order":504,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1236881,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rayna Tharani","original_name":"Rayna Tharani","popularity":3.719,"profile_path":"/iPYxjeaNRTaQKdDsUGH0xk3zP0v.jpg"},{"character":"Ken","credit_id":"54539c4e0e0a2648cb001575","order":505,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":147887,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Parks","original_name":"Bill Parks","popularity":2.72,"profile_path":"/9PRbMbpxH84yXUpDON6qvXckCM7.jpg"},{"character":"Henry","credit_id":"54539c580e0a2648cb001578","order":506,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1294883,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jon Barinholtz","original_name":"Jon Barinholtz","popularity":4.096,"profile_path":"/i4hRT1u9zrdgWd8dpl79Sh21oyL.jpg"},{"character":"Basketball Player","credit_id":"54539c64c3a368148d001558","order":507,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1380061,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Noelle Messier","original_name":"Noelle Messier","popularity":2.39,"profile_path":"/u0dj8tQF0oCKWSNFMATBt0IupH1.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2014-11-06","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1014455,"name":"Love, McCarthys Style","overview":"Ronny encourages his family to share their feelings after meeting his boyfriend's affectionate family.
