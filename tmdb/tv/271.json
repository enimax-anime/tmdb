The title role of Ellen Morgan, played by stand-up comedian Ellen DeGeneres, was a neurotic bookstore owner in her thirties.\n\nThe series centered on Ellen's dealing with her quirky friends, her family and the problems of daily life. The series is notable for being the first one in which the main character came out as gay, which DeGeneres' character did in the 1997 episode \"Puppy Episode\". This event received a great deal of media exposure, ignited controversy, and prompted ABC to place a parental advisory at the beginning of each episode.\n\nThe series' theme song, \"So Called Friend\" is by Scottish band Texas. A running gag was that each episode had a distinct opening credits sequence, resulting from Ellen's ongoing search for the perfect opening credits.","popularity":15.254,"poster_path":"/f9yc6wZLRQ3GSaN3IP7ailn8J4r.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1558,"logo_path":"/wwaKUcOENHix2jxLfFBfNkCtOEQ.png","name":"Touchstone Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":95467,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Black/Marlens Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":2,"id":864,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1994-03-29","episode_count":11,"id":862,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/zKpC7WWjJII0rGADB8PYUyvKipu.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1994-09-21","episode_count":24,"id":860,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/y83IVMn5rDO5C356AJT2oriadfX.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1995-09-13","episode_count":27,"id":861,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/arnEXLqHRMcBgekOcmARGthwdXz.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1996-09-18","episode_count":25,"id":863,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/wjQNkiKIk8cs4b8FU58rt01zt1f.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1997-09-24","episode_count":22,"id":859,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/21zTLWKew8kdCT5pln8faWNrkiK.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.382,"vote_count":38,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52534a7019c29579400f1141","air_date":"1994-03-29","episodes":[{"air_date":"1994-03-29","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":14653,"name":"Pilot","overview":"Ellen, mortified by her driver's license photo, pulls out all the stops in a desperate attempt to get a decent picture.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":271,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52534a9319c29579400f2481","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212506,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Neal Marlens","original_name":"Neal Marlens","popularity":2.607,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52534a8019c29579400f19e3","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1215065,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David S.
