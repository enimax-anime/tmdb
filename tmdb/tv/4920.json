The arc further details Malina's involvement with Frobisher's lawyer Ray Fiske and the pressure Patty brings to bear on Fiske on Malina's subsequent death.\n\nThe narrative includes multiple flashforwards of the alternative timeline, set approximately six months after Ellen's appointment, until both timelines converge in the penultimate episode of the season.

A former lover of Patty's, Daniel Purcell, brings the matter to her attention, but then inexplicably backs out, leaving Patty up against UNR CEO Walter Kendrick and his fierce lawyer Claire Maddox.

It consisted of thirteen episodes. Damages was created by brothers Todd and Glenn Kessler along with Daniel Zelman, each of whom served as executive producers and contributed seven scripts for the season, including the premiere and the finale.\n\nMost of the season follows two different timelines. The primary timeline begins with Ellen Parsons' recruitment by Patty Hewes to \"Hewes & Associates\" and follows proceedings of a class action lawsuit against Arthur Frobisher by his former employees, whom Patty represents. The initial episodes follow Patty's attempts to capture potential witness Gregory Malina through Katie Connor. The arc further details Malina's involvement with Frobisher's lawyer Ray Fiske and the pressure Patty brings to bear on Fiske on Malina's subsequent death.\n\nThe narrative includes multiple flashforwards of the alternative timeline, set approximately six months after Ellen's appointment, until both timelines converge in the penultimate episode of the season. The alternative timeline details the attack on Ellen, her arrest for the murder of her fiancé David Connor, and the subsequent murder investigation.","id":14681,"poster_path":"/zZyG3yaHHJmy8fAS11ayerOmcaI.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7.4},"2":{"_id":"52577bf5760ee36aaa58ada8","air_date":"2009-01-07","episodes":[{"air_date":"2009-01-07","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":346031,"name":"I Lied, Too.","overview":"Fresh off her legal victory over billionaire CEO Arthur Frobisher, Patty is taking a break from the law and pouring her energies into her new charitable foundation.
