Each episode features the self-recorded footage of a diverse group of every-day paranormal enthusiasts - from newlyweds and a brother-in-law to a trio of roommates.\n\nEach team of three will be stranded at one of the most haunted locations in America and record the entire experience with hand-held cameras creating a suspenseful, completely unscripted first-hand account of each group's stay.  Over the course of the confinement, the group will cope with increasingly pervasive feelings of fear and desolation, resulting in an experiment that represents a unique combination of psychology and the paranormal.","popularity":1.96,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3172,"logo_path":"/kDedjRZwO8uyFhuHamomOhN6fzG.png","name":"Blumhouse Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":20546,"logo_path":"/3QJWdH9UcYOOgjUdIH3cWAbgDI7.png","name":"Ping Pong Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2013-02-27","episode_count":6,"id":59979,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Reality","vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"53132213c3a36829e2003f81","air_date":"2013-02-27","episodes":[{"air_date":"2013-02-27","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":972851,"name":"Star Island","overview":"An ex-couple and their friend spend five days inside the historic and reportedly haunted, 200-room, Oceanic Hotel on the remote Star Island, which is 10-miles off the coast of New Hampshire.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":60604,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-03-06","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":972852,"name":"Seaview Terrace","overview":"Three friends from Brooklyn spend five days inside the 40,000 square foot gothic seaside mansion, Seaview Terrace (a.k.a.
