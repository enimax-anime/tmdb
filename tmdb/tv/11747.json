The series starred Phil Silvers as Master Sergeant Ernest G. Bilko of the United States Army.\n\nThe series was created and largely written by Nat Hiken, and won three consecutive Emmy Awards for Best Comedy Series. The show is sometimes titled Sergeant Bilko or simply Bilko in reruns, and is very often referred to by these names, both on-screen and by viewers. The show's success transformed Silvers from a journeyman comedian into a star, and writer-producer Hiken from a highly-regarded behind-the-scenes comedy writer into a publicly recognized creator.","popularity":17.662,"poster_path":"/r6PVPzI3Crqd7jUmnpxdtSrHwGa.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1081,"logo_path":"/19kn4jVvpc3sAL3YpZNb3elhSMl.png","name":"CBS Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":19,"id":22328,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/oTWLA10wGfq2EABNgenqNplKz1E.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1955-09-20","episode_count":34,"id":22324,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/fK9OY4tfpMQnttWIMhQ1fkHFjIL.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7.6},{"air_date":"1956-09-18","episode_count":36,"id":22325,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/9JH84ZwuIwDvMbmacWW1zecbax4.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":7.5},{"air_date":"1957-09-17","episode_count":37,"id":22326,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/mSHD3rKL9p1QrZriFcRDtMChXpL.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1958-09-23","episode_count":37,"id":22327,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/31VACdl8jc9SHo8Mz2k5u9tptX5.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.533,"vote_count":15,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525814cf19c29531db49e5e6","air_date":"1955-09-20","episodes":[{"air_date":"1955-09-20","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":463826,"name":"New Recruits","overview":"During a poker game the other sergeant's cheat and clean Bilko out of his bankroll  so he has to look around for some more money.
