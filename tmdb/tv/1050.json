The series was originally broadcast on the ABC and had two seasons of 13 episodes each, the first in 1998 and the second in 2000.\n\n'The Games' starred satirists John Clarke and Bryan Dawe along with Australian comedian Gina Riley and actor Nicholas Bell. It was written by John Clarke and Ross Stevenson. The series centred on the Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games and satirised corruption and cronyism in the Olympic movement, bureaucratic ineptness in the New South Wales public service, and unethical behaviour within politics and the media. An unusual feature of the show was that the characters shared the same name as the actors who played them, to enhance the illusion of a documentary on the Sydney Games.","popularity":3.678,"poster_path":"/yltjOYmZfNw6yYKAuJHp77DYkJM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1998-08-17","episode_count":13,"id":2982,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/8fv9phO47MlQh2qqBtTMsnBWKyB.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2000-06-19","episode_count":13,"id":2983,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/8fv9phO47MlQh2qqBtTMsnBWKyB.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5254142019c2957940364cc1","air_date":"1998-08-17","episodes":[{"air_date":"1998-08-17","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":55265,"name":"The Press Conference","overview":"Barrie Cassidy analyses John, Bryan and Gina's performance at their recent press conference.","production_code":"","runtime":26,"season_number":1,"show_id":1050,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Barrie Cassidy","credit_id":"620d610277b1fb0042ec0cc8","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1221951,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barrie Cassidy","original_name":"Barrie Cassidy","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":"1998-08-24","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":55266,"name":"Athletics Schedule","overview":"Just when the administration and logistics team have got things running smoothly, sport rears its ugly head.
