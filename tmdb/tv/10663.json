The show starred American comedian Flip Wilson; the program was one of the first American television programs starring a black person in the title role to become highly successful with a white audience. Specifically, it was the first successful network variety series starring an African American. During its first two seasons, its Nielsen ratings made it the nation's second most watched show.\n\nThe show consisted of many skits over an hour. It also broke new ground in American television by using a 'Theatre-in-the-Round' stage format, with the audience seated on all sides of a circular performance area.\n\nWilson was most famous for creating the role of Geraldine Jones, a sassy, modern woman who had a boyfriend named Killer. Flip also created the role of Reverend Leroy, who was the minister of the Church of What's Happening Now!. New parishioners were wary of coming to the church as it was hinted that Reverend Leroy was a con artist. Wilson popularized such catchphrases as \"What you see is what you get\", and \"The devil made me do it!\".","popularity":18.428,"poster_path":"/4qUf7B8eBZKjwjhfgU63J9OvQsT.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56760,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bob Henry Productions Inc.","origin_country":""},{"id":66721,"logo_path":null,"name":"Clerow Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":1502,"logo_path":"/ywjcvHUiKxv7cYsestkONF8LieH.png","name":"NBC","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1970-09-17","episode_count":27,"id":20955,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1971-09-16","episode_count":26,"id":20958,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1972-09-14","episode_count":25,"id":20956,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1973-09-20","episode_count":18,"id":20957,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.2,"vote_count":10,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258054319c29531db3a1a12","air_date":"1970-09-17","episodes":[{"air_date":"1970-09-17","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":432895,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"Guests stars David Frost, James Brown and The Muppets.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":10663,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5258054519c29531db3a1bed","order":515,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Brown","original_name":"James Brown","popularity":7.359,"profile_path":"/q9Q3c7HsZEEqrwNIY9yDgsJ74uE.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1970-09-24","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":432896,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"Guests stars Roy Clark, Bobby Darin, Stanley Myron and Denise Nicholas","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":10663,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5258054519c29531db3a1c2a","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1180886,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stanley Myron Handelman","original_name":"Stanley Myron Handelman","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5258054519c29531db3a1c44","order":540,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":65398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Denise Nicholas","original_name":"Denise Nicholas","popularity":7.12,"profile_path":"/iLVYN8DuUFqF6s6cYWO8Zu4B8YT.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5258054419c29531db3a1b0b","order":555,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1215645,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roy Clark","original_name":"Roy Clark","popularity":2.649,"profile_path":"/3sjFnrgKOGfCosE8ccMRFaub5dY.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5258054519c29531db3a1c5e","order":588,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Darin","original_name":"Bobby Darin","popularity":3.476,"profile_path":"/2IsNBGiXSnPkxlj39zFXOknuJpu.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1970-10-01","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":432897,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"Guests stars Lily Tomlin, Redd Foxx, The Tempatations and Roger Miller","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":10663,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5258054519c29531db3a1c98","order":513,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134439,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Roger Miller","original_name":"Roger Miller","popularity":3.465,"profile_path":"/zArWwwlAic2GtPr2xJ3pQPINXZi.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5258054519c29531db3a1cb2","order":547,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56949,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Redd Foxx","original_name":"Redd Foxx","popularity":1.95,"profile_path":"/kWpXo9XUjhs2KDXrwGeod4iMMld.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5258054519c29531db3a1ccc","order":589,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10437,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lily Tomlin","original_name":"Lily Tomlin","popularity":11.359,"profile_path":"/5y0iICTKzvLbAG3lgvxG4fH9ZUk.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1970-10-08","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":432899,"name":"Episode 4","overview":"Guests stars Perry Como, Charlie Callas, Denise Nicholas and Lola Falana.
