As he learns, Jacob's duties run deeper than just sending demons back to Hell; he later must prevent them all from escaping.\n\nUnlike most portrayals of exorcism and spirit possession in fiction, Apparitions is more religiously accurate and fact-based, incorporating the nature of demonic possession as described by the Church. It also recounts historical events associated with Christianity and other Abrahamic religions, which may have been caused by Heaven or Hell, indicating that the War described in the Bible may not have fully concluded.\n\nThe series is written by Joe Ahearne.","popularity":5.568,"poster_path":"/jpd7vaCQo2059Ju0yfxL1Ibo6Or.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2008-11-13","episode_count":6,"id":18231,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/uz2D6viCrNSdJ6vaKVzghlgHKmO.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":1}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.242,"vote_count":31,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52579057760ee36aaa6c9252","air_date":"2008-11-13","episodes":[{"air_date":"2008-11-13","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":394797,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"Father Jacob is approached by a young girl who believes her father is possessed by the devil.
