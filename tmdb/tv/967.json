Three segments were included in the program: one featuring Huckleberry Hound; another starring Yogi Bear and his sidekick Boo Boo; and a third with Pixie and Dixie and Mr. Jinks, two mice who in each short found a new way to outwit the cat Mr. Jinks. The Yogi Bear segment of the show proved more popular than Huckleberry's; it spawned its own series in 1961. A segment featuring Hokey Wolf and Ding-A-Ling was added, replacing Yogi Bear during the 1960–61 season. In 1961, the series became the first animated program to be honored with an Emmy Award. The Huckleberry Hound Show contributed to making Hanna-Barbera a household name, and is often credited with legitimizing the concept of animation produced specifically for television.","popularity":68.543,"poster_path":"/fur8UZZX0EhvvfjtxGzhPQzzdQ5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1353,"logo_path":"/yXhCcOFK5Fy3ZBQwhBYx8Zu9ZIw.png","name":"Hanna-Barbera Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1988-04-06","episode_count":5,"id":2770,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/cb5cU5ELQ9webiq6IPSz44urKxo.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1958-09-29","episode_count":66,"id":2771,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/ija3yatpGCJLfh56bj182FZSTvX.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1959-09-14","episode_count":39,"id":2772,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/sVUnxcxH8MKVVAma2C0TIWrsOGw.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1960-09-11","episode_count":39,"id":2773,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/vHA3kQcBV9aEBiMeJl2P1vNapvB.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1961-08-18","episode_count":34,"id":2774,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/Q1d1odrsWk4b3fXWQjGk7OsHpm.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":5.6}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":110,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5254100f19c2957940331e43","air_date":"1958-09-29","episodes":[{"air_date":"1958-09-29","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":51647,"name":"Huckleberry Hound Meets Wee Willie","overview":"Huckleberry Hound apprehends a 350-pound gorilla named Wee Willie who has gotten loose throughout the city.","production_code":"","runtime":7,"season_number":1,"show_id":967,"still_path":"/gFhuPFvG9AWZQXAd8zacPTUJ6hq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5254101319c295794033243d","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William Hanna","original_name":"William Hanna","popularity":6.735,"profile_path":"/zf5WRsouQN0ozuJ4vFosXylPjaZ.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"5254101319c295794033241b","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":109969,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daws Butler","original_name":"Daws Butler","popularity":4.318,"profile_path":"/qxaOMbICdts0qpUmkYj3OMhDGt8.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1958-09-29","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":3039795,"name":"Cousin Tex","overview":"Pixie and Dixie's country cousin comes by for a visit and tries his version of country tricks on Jinks.","production_code":"","runtime":7,"season_number":1,"show_id":967,"still_path":"/rovTuQ5U8I8M2XSuOaeGpoXxLuS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1958-09-29","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":3039796,"name":"Yogi Bear's Big Break","overview":"Sick of children saying \"Hey, Mom, hey, Mom.
