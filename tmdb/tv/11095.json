In Montana, Percell is now a carpenter and is nearly freaked' out by finding a Vietnamese worker on the crew. That same night he runs into a peace-activist at a blind date. Bill Griner returns home to North Carolina -- having been blinded. His parents turn to faith healing and Griner retreats to the \"\"comfort of the fields and a faithful dog\"\". Back in Vietnam, Taylor meets a new black soldier who tells him that he came back because the world is nowhere for a \"\"black\"\".
