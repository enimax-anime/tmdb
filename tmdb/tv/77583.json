Eventually forced to face his family, and the boxing ring, all hell breaks loose after an incident with an opponent - and Tommy ends up on the wrong end of a revenge story. This is great news to wannabe boxing promoter Kevin Smallwood who soon becomes intimately involved in the affairs of the Ross family. To make life even messier, Tommy is trying to parent a child he didn’t know he had and win back Pamela at the same time. Sylvia is struggling as a queen without a castle, Ginny can’t convince Chesley to give up the search for his own father and Lowly Jr gives romance a go for the first time.",
