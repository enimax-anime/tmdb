The film documents the work of the lead detectives as they investigate and interview the suspect about his involvement in a plot to shoot a man.\r\nWhile driving to work, the victim was hit from behind by another vehicle. When he stepped out to inspect the damage he was shot in his leg by a close range sawn-off shotgun, sustaining life-threatening injuries.\r\nThe police believe the case arises from a potential love triangle that has spiralled out of control. Detectives have 24 hours to gather enough evidence to charge or release him.",
