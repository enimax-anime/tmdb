Their lives, however, are much more complicated than the fate that brought them together, and soon the two are forced to separate. Over the years they remain linked by an intense correspondence, never able to muster the courage to see each other. However, 20 years after their first meeting and now adults, they meet again in Bologna. Their feeling, which has never faded over time, will have to clash with the interferences of a reality more complex than the one they had created only through words.",
