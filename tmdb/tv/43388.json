Off the Cape, gannets race high above the waves. They are the dolphins’ keen eyes in the sky. From up here they readily spot the whorling shoals of sardines, and the first gannet to take the plunge sparks a feeding frenzy of gannets, dolphins, sharks and whales. Along the shore, kelp gulls follow young seals as they take to the sea for the first time. The gulls know that great white sharks hunt in these waters and will prepare dinner for them.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":43388,"still_path":"/8cSMKIsjIkFL3mrN6DK3gO0Spzp.jpg","vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-01-12","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":887824,"name":"Europe","overview":"Rome, Venice, London … Earthflight departs on its grand European tour, and takes filming to new heights.
