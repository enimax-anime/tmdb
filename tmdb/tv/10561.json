Mal Hennessey is charged with murder, with Shirl Hennessey being an accessory after the fact.\n\nKidd believes that Mal has no chance of walking away a free man, and the only way he can save Shirl from a lengthy jail sentence is for Mal to plead guilty. However, trying to convince Mal of this will be one of the biggest challenges of Michael Kidd's illustrious career.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"1995-04-20","episode_number":13,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":10561,"still_path":null},"name":"Janus","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":18,"logo_path":"/kMvN5R8g6L0SY5r9YZw9foYGQr0.png","name":"ABC TV","origin_country":"AU"}],"number_of_episodes":26,"number_of_seasons":2,"origin_country":["AU"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Janus","overview":"Janus is an Australian drama television series screened on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation in 1994 and 1995. Two series were produced, with a total of 26 episodes.\n\nJanus was a spin-off series from the earlier ABC-TV crime series Phoenix.\n\nLoosely based on the true story of Melbourne's Pettingill family and the Walsh Street police shootings, Janus follows the bitterly-fought prosecutions of a notorious criminal family, the Hennesseys, from the viewpoints of the family, the police and, in particular, the lawyers, prosecutors, barristers and judges involved in all aspects of the story.\n\nWhen the series begins, four members of the infamous Hennessey clan are acquitted of the shooting of two young policemen in a bungled bank heist. The city of Melbourne is shocked as brothers Mal and Steve, along with brother-in-law Darren Mack and friend Ken Hardy, walk free.\n\nThe prosecutors, judges, magistrates and police—many modelled heavily on real-life legal figures—are determined to put the Hennessey members behind bars if they can. But corruption, legal loopholes, delays, and stretched resources combine to make the quest to jail the group far from straightforward.","popularity":3.59,"poster_path":"/uOVsNtECSWbRFgYw1Nzb9Bxy7zs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1253,"logo_path":"/6f0A0AqIPHYheRb90tVMutuzSnP.png","name":"Australian Broadcasting Corporation","origin_country":"AU"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1994-09-01","episode_count":13,"id":20816,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1995-01-26","episode_count":13,"id":20817,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258043119c29531db38ef41","air_date":"1994-09-01","episodes":[{"air_date":"1994-09-01","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":430900,"name":"Malice Aforethought (Part 1)","overview":"Four men, all career criminals, are charged over the fatal shooting of a policeman and the serious wounding of another, during an armed hold up.

Kidd is forced to look at other cases to maintain his lifestyle of expensive cars and fast bikes. He takes on the defence of a young law student charged with culpable driving after a car accident left one girl dead and another one seriously injured. Prosecutor Jenny Hanson is daunted by the prospect of appearing against the legendary Michael Kidd. Ian Bisley is more concerned about his future as a solicitor than the death of the young girl, and will not admit to himself that he is responsible. He flatters Kidd, clouding the barrister's normally astute legal mind. Kidd's defence is uninspiring, and Bisley is convicted and sentenced to two years in jail.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":10561,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Stunt
