In short order, she convinces Higgins to hand over the keys to the Ferrari and to relocate Thomas to the main house while she works in the guest house, much to Thomas's extreme displeasure. After Thomas is forced by a lack of transportation to let her observe his investigation of a hit-and-run insurance case, she begins to churn out a story inspired by Thomas's case, featuring Thomas as dashing international investigator Sebastian Sabre, Higgins as his faithful servant Boris, T.C. as his pilot Winston, Rick as club owner Swift, and herself as Sabre's glamorous girlfriend Collette. Her wild imagination unwittingly breaks open Thomas's investigation and plunges them both into danger.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":5,"show_id":734,"still_path":"/g216gini5gEcwUdOBYrQZem8JuP.jpg","vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5253926419c29579402a2d20","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":104019,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Patterson","original_name":"John Patterson","popularity":2.084,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5253922719c295794029f4e7","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64745,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jay Huguely","original_name":"Jay Huguely","popularity":0.84,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"5253925e19c29579402a26ed","order":618,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":47457,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cassie Yates","original_name":"Cassie Yates","popularity":4.06,"profile_path":"/nswukO6QGcqjIP0VCLlBZiDtYEZ.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"5253926419c29579402a2ce2","order":698,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7675,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Gleason","original_name":"Paul Gleason","popularity":11.815,"profile_path":"/a7PJofFcVpDxw2wAak1d56J7L4k.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"5253920319c295794029d63e","order":778,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10345,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Soon-Tek Oh","original_name":"Soon-Tek Oh","popularity":5.571,"profile_path":"/m2qkVJLmfcNYQe85bJ5iuF6e8ha.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1985-01-03","episode_number":12,"episode_type":"standard","id":40186,"name":"Little Games","overview":"Higgins is outraged when Thomas's game playing crashes the estate's security computer system, thereby jeopardizing the selection of the estate for an upcoming multi-million dollar jewelery design competition;
