They perform an Enslavement Ritual in an attempt to subjugate him, but the spell backfires and causes them to become his slaves instead. With the situation now becoming more awkward than ever, Takuma decides to accompany the girls in finding a way to unbind their contract while learning to adapt to his new existence as the menacing Demon King.","popularity":42.084,"poster_path":"/oVozVLWMTej4CRBpfu0ehxofBHS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":43368,"logo_path":"/cDPK8iNO14z2oxbl57Dcd8m23RZ.png","name":"Ajiado","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":4262,"logo_path":"/K1m4DWOObFOKCJp6XGOskEKymE.png","name":"Tezuka Productions","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":133501,"logo_path":"/sLuyHvpLctHcBytC23M7a3TK6Ar.png","name":"Okuruto Noboru","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2018-07-05","episode_count":12,"id":105821,"name":"Season 1","overview":"In the MMORPG Cross Reverie, Takuma Sakamoto is so powerful that he is lauded as the “Demon Lord” by other players.
