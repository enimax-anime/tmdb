The protagonists were Michael Murray, the Militant tendency-supporting Labour leader of a city council in the North of England and Jim Nelson, the headmaster of a school for disturbed children.\n\nThe series was controversial partly because Murray appeared to be based on Derek Hatton, former Deputy Leader of Liverpool City Council â€” in an interview in the G.B.H. DVD Bleasdale recounts an accidental meeting with Hatton before the series, who indicates that he has caught wind of Bleasdale's intentions but does not mind as long as the actor playing him is \"handsome\".\n\nIn normal parlance, the initials \"GBH\" refer to the criminal charge of grievous bodily harm - however, the actual intent of the letters is that it is supposed to stand for Great British Holiday.","popularity":11.298,"poster_path":"/fBlFKneBgEGAH1yeV0x3Nxll1AZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":57869,"logo_path":null,"name":"GBH Films Ltd.","origin_country":""},{"id":5778,"logo_path":"/2loyoQweDxvotH3AknfL2zhsthg.png","name":"Channel 4 Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":750,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1991-06-06","episode_count":7,"id":749,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":9,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5253472e19c29579400d5f90","air_date":"1991-06-06","episodes":[{"air_date":"1991-06-06","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":13186,"name":"It Couldn't Happen Here","overview":"Firebrand Labour leader Michael Murray is swept into office on a tide of rhetoric. His first act is to \"reform education\", but it looks suspiciously like a personal vendetta against Mr. Weller, the headmaster who had once sent him, as a boy, to a special school for disturbed children. When Murray is summoned by the renowned political theorist, Mervyn Sloan, he is told that great things are expected of him. But Sloan also firmly insists that a general strike be called in Murray's city to challenge the Conservative Government. When one of Murray's council members, who has a weakness for the bottle, fails to ensure pickets are sent to one particular school, a disastrous conflict ensues between Murray and Jim Nelson, who is unfortunately headmaster of a school for special needs children.","production_code":"","runtime":81,"season_number":1,"show_id":235,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Dr Jacobs","credit_id":"575e9cd99251413340000d88","order":18,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":940,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Shrapnel","original_name":"John Shrapnel","popularity":4.943,"profile_path":"/A4Wmltbkz3sz79GcBkLeTqwfkvE.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1991-06-13","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":13187,"name":"Only Here on a Message","overview":"Michael Murray is beginning to realise that his new-found political \"friends\" are not being entirely above-board with him.\n\nJim Nelson, meanwhile, gains some respite from Murray's persecution when he becomes a local hero in a tragic accident. Though his attempt to save his pupil, Robbie Burns, is not successful, his efforts earn him the undying loyalty of Robbie's father, Norman, and his formidable brothers. After a time, however, Murray resumes the pressure and Jim begins to come unravelled, manifesting as a new phobia for bridges.
