Race relations become a hot topic in the Banks household when Will’s mother, Vy (guest star Vernee Watson-Johnson, Southland; Sister, Sister), has trouble accepting that her sister Janice (guest star Charlayne Woodard, ER) is marrying a Caucasian man. And Philip and Vivian’s past returns with open arms when a Sixties radical is invited into their home. Hilarity and heart combine in the second season of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air.

While Will tries to work his mojo on reluctant Monique (Kim Fields, Living Single), Hilary (Karyn Parsons) breaks into show business and learns some hard lessons. But the kids aren’t the only ones riding life’s highs and lows. Philip (James Avery) jumps into the race for superior court judge, opposing his sleazy but powerful former mentor (Sherman Hemsley, The Jeffersons).

When they’re not hunting the honeys, like the superhot Jackie (Tyra Banks), the boys pledge a fraternity, where Will finds out that racism cuts both ways. At home, Will sneaks the dieting Philip (James Avery) some snacks, not realizing he’s endangering his uncle’s life. And Ashley (Tatyana Ali) breaks out of her childhood shell in a big way by undergoing an extremely sexy makeover, exploring the dating world and demanding some “Respect” from her parents by belting out the classic song.

All that romance must be contagious, because Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) finds his soul sister through online dating. Unfortunately, that’s only half right. It’s Hilary (Karyn Parsons). And there’s a lot more than love going on as Will grapples with a big orange whale, a mobster, a bear, Jay Leno, Lisa’s cantankerous dad, and in one of the series’ most memorable episodes, a bullet with his name on it.

In the second season of this inspiring comedy, as the Banks family continues to adjust to Will living with them in Bel-Air, they find themselves questioning how they live in the process. Meanwhile, Will’s fear of becoming like his uptight Uncle Philip and his preppy cousin Carlton prompts him to take drastic action to make sure this doesn’t happen. Race relations become a hot topic in the Banks household when Will’s mother, Vy (guest star Vernee Watson-Johnson, Southland; Sister, Sister), has trouble accepting that her sister Janice (guest star Charlayne Woodard, ER) is marrying a Caucasian man. And Philip and Vivian’s past returns with open arms when a Sixties radical is invited into their home. Hilarity and heart combine in the second season of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Guest stars this season include Nicholle Tom (The Nanny), Allen Payne (House of Payne) and members of New Edition Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins and Ronnie DeVoe.","id":5427,"poster_path":"/yAyfo1FvWdXK6NzlKobeTIVGmNK.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":7.7},"3":{"_id":"5257185d19c29571140a4b87","air_date":"1992-09-14","episodes":[{"air_date":"1992-09-14","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":118928,"name":"How I Spent My Summer Vacation","overview":"Will returns home from spending the summer in Philadelphia with a new look that doesn't sit well with Uncle Phil.","production_code":"","runtime":24,"season_number":3,"show_id":1892,"still_path":"/cLcs4eq4LnQDMCam25yv3HkZHSp.jpg","vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":8,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257185e19c29571140a4c49","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1212805,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Winifred Hervey","original_name":"Winifred Hervey","popularity":2.849,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5257186219c29571140a4ff0","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shelley Jensen","original_name":"Shelley Jensen","popularity":2.853,"profile_path":"/AbXIXwaMVQ04GA3aZDMN22IQPsY.jpg"},{"job":"Hairstylist","department":"Costume & Make-Up","credit_id":"58696a3bc3a3680f4b00f2a9","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1532251,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Carol McCoo","original_name":"Carol McCoo","popularity":1.164,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Co-Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"58723a6a925141356c015d23","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1731205,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bryan Winter","original_name":"Bryan Winter","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"58723a739251413564015dfe","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1735146,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Doutt","original_name":"John Doutt","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Co-Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"58723a619251413561015dac","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1709790,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Efrem Seeger","original_name":"Efrem Seeger","popularity":0.666,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Sound Re-Recording Mixer","department":"Sound","credit_id":"58723ac5c3a3684f0a014327","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1735149,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Fred Tator","original_name":"Fred Tator","popularity":0.615,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Costume Design","department":"Costume & Make-Up","credit_id":"58723a929251413561015ddc","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1417489,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Violette Jones-Faison","original_name":"Violette Jones-Faison","popularity":1.96,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Script Supervisor","department":"Directing","credit_id":"58696a6cc3a3680f5800fbe1","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1731015,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mattie Caruthers","original_name":"Mattie Caruthers","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5869b6169251414e8a011e49","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1212805,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Winifred Hervey","original_name":"Winifred Hervey","popularity":2.849,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Casting","department":"Production","credit_id":"586a5c789251414e7f0190f9","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1634776,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Monica Swann","original_name":"Monica Swann","popularity":1.899,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Assistant Art Director","department":"Art","credit_id":"58723abd925141356c015d7d","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1735148,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Alan Okazaki","original_name":"Alan Okazaki","popularity":0.705,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Art Direction","department":"Art","credit_id":"58723a869251413559016799","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1731203,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Fred M.

Will (Will Smith) and Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) are living large at college — even though they live in their family’s pool house. When they’re not hunting the honeys, like the superhot Jackie (Tyra Banks), the boys pledge a fraternity, where Will finds out that racism cuts both ways. At home, Will sneaks the dieting Philip (James Avery) some snacks, not realizing he’s endangering his uncle’s life. And Ashley (Tatyana Ali) breaks out of her childhood shell in a big way by undergoing an extremely sexy makeover, exploring the dating world and demanding some “Respect” from her parents by belting out the classic song. Donald Trump, Hugh Hefner, Dick Clark, Ben Vereen (Roots), Robert Guillaume (Benson), Pam Grier (Jackie Brown), jazzman Branford Marsalis and Boys II Men guest star in this laugh-filled 26-episode season of the freshest show around.","id":5430,"poster_path":"/qCEnFInR3qQ9PLoLkWDIGdq46SA.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":7.8},"5":{"_id":"5257185e19c29571140a4bea","air_date":"1994-09-19","episodes":[{"air_date":"1994-09-19","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":119005,"name":"The Client","overview":"Will revels in Ashley's music industry success, but both Will and Ashley are about to have a rude surprise.","production_code":"","runtime":23,"season_number":5,"show_id":1892,"still_path":"/9Kta3WTL2ggR52hFTZulRCUphES.jpg","vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":7,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5257186219c29571140a4ff0","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":134133,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Shelley Jensen","original_name":"Shelley Jensen","popularity":2.853,"profile_path":"/AbXIXwaMVQ04GA3aZDMN22IQPsY.jpg"},{"job":"Foley","department":"Sound","credit_id":"587a9e8ac3a36846c3006516","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1372207,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Leslie Bloome","original_name":"Leslie Bloome","popularity":2.156,"profile_path":"/4JBCrVTUdrFYcZd2EsMUqUZsW8c.jpg"},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5257188219c29571140a6bb6","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224453,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Zuckerman","original_name":"David Zuckerman","popularity":2.34,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5257189f19c29571140a82d5","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51679,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Ridley","original_name":"John Ridley","popularity":2.725,"profile_path":"/cORKkGcAHz6I6qiFFPMpjFiyxaW.jpg"},{"job":"Makeup Department Head","department":"Costume & Make-Up","credit_id":"5867e9d69251414e7a000871","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1730506,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Joann Kozloff","original_name":"Joann Kozloff","popularity":1.66,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Executive Consultant","department":"Production","credit_id":"5867e2349251414e78000383","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1730508,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Susan Borowitz","original_name":"Susan Borowitz","popularity":1.15,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Supervising Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"587a9ee3c3a3684a270079bb","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1731104,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bennie R.

In Season 5 of Fresh Prince, Will (Smith) meets Lisa (Nia Long) — and before you can say “Go slow, bro,” he’s in love, engaged, and standing before the minister with 50 pounds of iced shrimp melting in the banquet hall. All that romance must be contagious, because Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) finds his soul sister through online dating. Unfortunately, that’s only half right. It’s Hilary (Karyn Parsons). And there’s a lot more than love going on as Will grapples with a big orange whale, a mobster, a bear, Jay Leno, Lisa’s cantankerous dad, and in one of the series’ most memorable episodes, a bullet with his name on it.

After Will (Will Smith) becomes Hilary's (Karyn Parsons) talent coordinator, her show goes national and she is lured to New York, where Ashley (Tatyana Ali) hopes to model. When Philip (James Avery) presides over a high-profile Hollywood case, his ambition almost ruins his marriage. In the series finale, he shows the house to prospective buyers played by classic sitcom stars Sherman Hemsley, Isabel Sanford and Marla Gibbs (The Jeffersons), and Gary Coleman and Conrad Bain (Diff'rent Strokes). With their home sold, the Banks parents head east to be closer to Ashley and Hilary; butler Geoffrey (Joseph Marcell) moves to London; Carlton (Alfonso Ribeiro) attends Princeton; and Will looks forward to his post-college future. Chris Rock, Wayne Newton, Dick Clark, B.B. King, Jay Leno, William Shatner, Regis Philbin, Richard Roundtree and Jaleel White (Family Matters) also guest star.","id":5431,"poster_path":"/kM0XBzF8Hdzc2KLAaNq6BZqFnAa.jpg","season_number":6,"vote_average":7.7}}}
