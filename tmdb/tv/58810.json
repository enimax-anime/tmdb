Blackbeard, reigns over a rogue nation of thieves, outlaws and miscreant sailors. Part shantytown, part marauder's paradise, this is a place like no other on earth - and a mounting threat to international commerce. To gain control of this fearsome society, Tom Lowe, a highly skilled undercover assassin, is sent to the buccaneers' haven to take down the brilliant and charismatic Blackbeard. But the closer Lowe gets, the more he finds that his quest is not so simple. Lowe can't help but admire the political ideals of Blackbeard, whose thirst for knowledge knows no bounds - and no law. But Lowe is not the only danger to Blackbeard's rule. He is a man with many villainous rivals and one great weakness - a passionately driven woman whom he cannot deny.","popularity":8.171,"poster_path":"/l1FvNiEC61VvuNPkaKMseDXnDGc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":24666,"logo_path":null,"name":"Mr. Cross","origin_country":""},{"id":26727,"logo_path":"/jeTxdjXhzgKZyLr3l9MllkTn3fy.png","name":"Universal Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":49325,"logo_path":null,"name":"Parkes+MacDonald Image Nation","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2014-05-14","episode_count":1,"id":59214,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2014-05-30","episode_count":9,"id":59215,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/t3C8oLlr5g3vlqEHCcToNsbcRQT.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7.8}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.07,"vote_count":65,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52598d5a760ee34661b4c9da","air_date":"2014-05-30","episodes":[{"air_date":"2014-05-30","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":947518,"name":"The Devil's Dominion","overview":"The Longitude Chronometer, a device that will change the world, is stolen from HMS Petrel by pirates working for the legendary but supposedly long dead Edward Teach - better known as Blackbeard.
