Some notable series regulars include Detective Tony Logozzo in seasons 1-2, Sgt. Frank Coscarella in seasons 3-4, Sgt. Len Harper in seasons 5-7, Insp. Vince Schneider season 1, Insp.

This along with the new sets, a significant revamp of the credits and theme music, and even having McCormick's hair change from auburn to dirty-blonde all contributed to a considerable reworking of the series.","popularity":11.361,"poster_path":"/osBRrzhK7RntjQyagnkK5fyb1xP.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1998-01-23","episode_count":11,"id":1808,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":8.5},{"air_date":"1998-09-25","episode_count":15,"id":1806,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":8.1},{"air_date":"1999-10-22","episode_count":13,"id":1810,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":7.8},{"air_date":"2000-10-06","episode_count":20,"id":1811,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2001-09-29","episode_count":13,"id":1812,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5,"vote_average":8.2},{"air_date":"2002-09-21","episode_count":13,"id":1807,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":6,"vote_average":8.2},{"air_date":"2004-09-04","episode_count":13,"id":1809,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":7,"vote_average":8}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":9,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5253897319c29579402367ff","air_date":"1998-01-23","episodes":[{"air_date":"1998-01-23","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":34076,"name":"Christopher Williams","overview":"Christopher Gerald Williams was ten when he was taken from the bedroom he shared with his seven-year-old brother Joey in 1977.
