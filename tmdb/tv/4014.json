The success of the mini series led to its return the following year as an on-going series with McFarlane being joined by a new doctor, Chris Randall, played by Liz Burch. McFarlane left during the first season and actor Robert Grubb came in as new doctor Geoff Standish.\n\nThe series' episodes were mostly self-contained but also featured ongoing storylines, such as Dr. Standish's romance with Sister Kate Wellings. Other major characters included pilot Sam Patterson, mechanic Emma Plimpton, local policeman Sgt. Jack Carruthers and Vic and Nancy Buckley, who ran the local pub/hotel, The Majestic. Andrew McFarlane also later returned to the series, resuming his role as Dr. Callaghan. The popular series ran for nine seasons and was successfully screened internationally.","popularity":21.293,"poster_path":"/Aj4xa7lo9RwTV6DpZ3Pcjgp26Ht.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":75144,"logo_path":null,"name":"Crawfords Australia","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1985-03-12","episode_count":3,"id":11875,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/38748TdaS5FpiA0yAsPRLol8ZfU.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1986-05-15","episode_count":26,"id":11868,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/6txgz2LANNrRcVzk1cuhTgNdnUL.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1987-07-07","episode_count":24,"id":11869,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/pcJPbfUWukOlj8qwi2E4ZZaM2ap.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1988-03-03","episode_count":26,"id":11870,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/pQwB3aDulBABGJR204nf1VGJpZv.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1988-09-08","episode_count":24,"id":11871,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/uZvcunWCCwOHkJ4Wbhqr17zaZp3.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1989-08-31","episode_count":26,"id":11872,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/n3EJAGOg3tgmToC17spUZpsLr4n.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1990-03-01","episode_count":20,"id":11873,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":"/6hab1AbvFXiHKwcQJ8QeKyCbZYE.jpg","season_number":6,"vote_average":9},{"air_date":"1990-07-18","episode_count":20,"id":11874,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":"/motrqa9NWlU2rMXE9mYdzLTMg1v.jpg","season_number":7,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1991-01-24","episode_count":26,"id":11877,"name":"Season 8","overview":"","poster_path":"/AoEahVwuTKH5JemBcgmZqLanW9D.jpg","season_number":8,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1991-08-08","episode_count":29,"id":11876,"name":"Season 9","overview":"","poster_path":"/7n9np5RoKTk6sw6HpMj4jNsr0jY.jpg","season_number":9,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.4,"vote_count":12,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52575a09760ee36aaa2960df","air_date":"1986-05-15","episodes":[{"air_date":"1986-05-15","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":278376,"name":"Will to Survive","overview":"Tom and Kate are on a clinicround.
