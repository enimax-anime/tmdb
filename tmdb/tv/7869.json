It stars nine characters from the DreamWorks Animation animated film Madagascar: The penguins Skipper, Kowalski, Private, and Rico; the lemurs King Julien, Maurice, and Mort; and Mason and Phil the chimpanzees. Characters new to the series include Marlene the otter and a zookeeper named Alice. It is the first Nicktoon produced with DreamWorks Animation.\n\nA pilot episode, \"Gone in a Flash\", aired as part of \"Superstuffed Nicktoons Weekend\" on November 29, 2008, and The Penguins of Madagascar became a regular series on March 28, 2009. The series premiere drew 6.1 million viewers, setting a new record as the most-watched premiere.\n\nAlthough the series occasionally alludes to the rest of the franchise, The Penguins of Madagascar does not take place at a precise time within it. McGrath, who is also the co-creator of the film characters, has said that the series takes place \"not specifically before or after the movie, I just wanted them all back at the zoo. I think of it as taking place in a parallel universe.\"","popularity":69.859,"poster_path":"/1fRG81M83HgwupmndtgZQOBHh8o.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2005-10-07","episode_count":4,"id":61700,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2008-11-28","episode_count":48,"id":61697,"name":"Season
