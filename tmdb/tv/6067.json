Every Sky Knight is trapped in a crystal prison and their vehicles scrapped. Only the Storm Hawks remain, playing childish pranks on Cyclonis. Piper is in bad shape, the Binding slowly weakening her despite not using it. Cyclonis, tired of their resistance, threatens to destroy Terra Atmosia, and the Storm hawks surrender to prevent it. This turns out to be a ploy to reach the crystal prison, which Aerrow shatters with help from Piper. The freed Sky Knights attempt to shoot down Cyclonia with stolen Skimmers, but cannot penetrate the shielding on the levitation pontoons. Stork and Finn, however, discover that the crystal technology the Night Crawlers wear is allergic to Radarr's fur. Meanwhile, Aerrow and Piper face Cyclonis and the Dark Ace. Already quite weak, Piper's ability to empower Aerrow ultimately gives out. However, when Aerrow insists they will die together, the Binding flows from him and into her, restoring her health and empowering them both. Unable to defeat them with her ordinary skills, Cyclonis draws power from her far side crystal to empower the Dark Ace, but gets carried away and destroys him. The resulting energy release destroys the far side crystal, allowing Finn and Junko to disable the pontoons. Cyclonis escapes through the door to the other side while the Storm Hawks follow. The end scene is narrated by Starling, who relates that it has been six hours since their victory. They raise up a flag of the Storm Hawks, the bravest heroes Atmos has ever known. Meanwhile, the Storm Hawks make it to the other side filled with new creatures and places. The story continues in season three of Storm Hawks at the other side of the Atmos.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"2009-04-06","episode_number":26,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":2,"show_id":6067,"still_path":null},"name":"Storm Hawks","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":46,"logo_path":"/1vBZP6weH5iSbSVHkJWi3pDpIpJ.png","name":"YTV","origin_country":"CA"}],"number_of_episodes":52,"number_of_seasons":2,"origin_country":["US","CA"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Storm Hawks","overview":"Storm Hawks is an animated television series created by Asaph \"Ace\" Fipke and made by Nerd Corps Entertainment in conjunction and collaboration with Cartoon Network and YTV.

Ravess abuses her power at Snipe's expense, so Snipe stages a mutiny with the help of the commander from \"Radarr Love\" and takes control of Cyclonia. More concerned with his own amusement than running Cyclonia, Snipe ignores the commander that helped him and carelessly orders the Talons to shoot down anyone that approaches, which happens to be Repton and the Raptors.

However, because of them Aerrow and his friends are captured. The leader of the Youth Squad radios Snipe and is told to throw them into the Wastelands. Junko volunteers to do it, but lets them go when the others are not looking, as he does not want to be a bad guy.

The bandit swears revenge on Finn. Elsewhere, the Storm Hawks reach the temple, only to find Ravess there instead of the doorway or the monster. Disgruntled by her banishment, she tells them that the door leads to the far side of Atmos, but without the key Cyclonis cannot open it. Back on the western terra, Finn's ego gets the better of him and he makes his own squad called the Ultra Dudes, teaching them useless tricks.

Every Sky Knight is trapped in a crystal prison and their vehicles scrapped. Only the Storm Hawks remain, playing childish pranks on Cyclonis. Piper is in bad shape, the Binding slowly weakening her despite not using it. Cyclonis, tired of their resistance, threatens to destroy Terra Atmosia, and the Storm hawks surrender to prevent it. This turns out to be a ploy to reach the crystal prison, which Aerrow shatters with help from Piper. The freed Sky Knights attempt to shoot down Cyclonia with stolen Skimmers, but cannot penetrate the shielding on the levitation pontoons. Stork and Finn, however, discover that the crystal technology the Night Crawlers wear is allergic to Radarr's fur. Meanwhile, Aerrow and Piper face Cyclonis and the Dark Ace. Already quite weak, Piper's ability to empower Aerrow ultimately gives out.
