Following her grandfather’s wishes for her to study the gayageum, she enrolls as a major of gugak, or traditional Korean music. Lee Shin is unfriendly, yet a clever student in the Applied Music Department who also is the famed vocalist and talented guitarist of the handsome band named The Stupid. With charming looks equal to those of a handsome character in a romance comic and a cold, taciturn personality, he thinks gugak is boring and belittles it. As the vocalist Lee Shin and Gayageum Protégé Lee Gyu Won passionately confront each other to champion their respective music, they soon fall in love.","popularity":10.831,"poster_path":"/lKKsxJOsfQT5CB6MYeWAHKA3g42.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":29249,"logo_path":null,"name":"JS Pictures","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2011-07-21","episode_count":1,"id":50652,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2011-06-29","episode_count":15,"id":50653,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/a2JHL4wcUg8KRgTxzl72TMyhtk8.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":28,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258ef5f760ee346618ebe3f","air_date":"2011-06-29","episodes":[{"air_date":"2011-06-29","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":865897,"name":"Encountering You By Accident","overview":"Serendipitously, the diverse lives of two Korean university music students converge, one a traditional gayageum player and the other the handsome but socially cold lead singer of a popular rock band called The Stupid.","production_code":"","runtime":66,"season_number":1,"show_id":39198,"still_path":"/8iLuEyzw9EfRVIg1vDOlHdOW8V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-06-30","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":865898,"name":"That is My World","overview":"It's Wind Flowers versus The Stupid as Gyu-won and Shin make a bet over which has soul, traditional music or western music.","production_code":"","runtime":65,"season_number":1,"show_id":39198,"still_path":"/seJyIfyEnprppvKAn2idInt5NGo.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-07-06","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":865900,"name":"Champion","overview":"As director of the 100th anniversary show, Suk-hyun disturbs the professors by changing laid plans in order to present what seems a very personal story.","production_code":"","runtime":62,"season_number":1,"show_id":39198,"still_path":"/h0U9JxJJnYGINRu3tMcEj71Xchu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-07-07","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":865899,"name":"Towards Tomorrow","overview":"With acting rehearsals underway, several girls aim to put Gyu-won in her place, whereby Gyu-won decides to quit the show.","production_code":"","runtime":65,"season_number":1,"show_id":39198,"still_path":"/wGnFuA5vxltZZWur1iZmSN2HMPQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-07-13","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":865902,"name":"Confession","overview":"A surprise kiss leaves Gyu-won, Suk-hyun and Yoon-soo stunned, and Shin ends Gyu-won's servitude.","production_code":"","runtime":66,"season_number":1,"show_id":39198,"still_path":"/8CDF3l7mEMcdNc4HxelzoLjH4E8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-07-14","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":865901,"name":"With The Thought That It Must Be Forgotten","overview":"Still reeling from a broken heart, personal tragedy touches Shin's life as well.","production_code":"","runtime":66,"season_number":1,"show_id":39198,"still_path":"/uzYyecFw2DDmBd3hJjDskQimOho.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-07-20","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":865903,"name":"Like This...
