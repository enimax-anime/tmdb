Tracing the origins of Egypt's unique visual style, he treks across the Sahara and travels the Nile to find the rarely-seen art of its earliest peoples. Exploring how this civilisation's art reflected its religion, he looks anew at the Great Pyramid, and the statuary and painting of the Old Kingdom. Sooke is amazed by the technical prowess of ancient artists whose skills confound contemporary craftsmen.","production_code":"","runtime":59,"season_number":1,"show_id":65025,"still_path":"/fPET4xbgAJSZEXvU9gjFkgcD5Hm.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5ba6579bc3a3680e6500c527","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1257703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alastair Sooke","original_name":"Alastair Sooke","popularity":2.651,"profile_path":"/in8f8Xw38Sw8EUDiK5jZUssGUdc.jpg"},{"job":"Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5ba657b40e0a2635e100dab3","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Dunn","original_name":"Tim Dunn","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5ba6578e0e0a2635e700d921","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1349467,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tim Dunn","original_name":"Tim Dunn","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Self","credit_id":"613dbdc7efca000044ed8b44","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2475627,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Salima Ikram","original_name":"Salima Ikram","popularity":4.203,"profile_path":"/oFsmRFgHMpBRk79G6d2CJBXt68s.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2014-01-16","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1576370,"name":"The Golden Age","overview":"On a journey through Ancient Egyptian art, Alastair Sooke picks treasures from its most opulent and glittering moment. Starting with troubling psychological portraits of tyrant king Senwosret III and ending with the golden mask of boy king Tutankhamun, Sooke also explores architectural wonders, exquisite tombs and a lost city - site of the greatest artistic revolution in Egypt's history where a new sinuous style was born under King Akhenaten and Queen Nefertiti. Along the way Egyptologists and artists reveal that the golden veneer conceals a touching humanity.","production_code":"","runtime":59,"season_number":1,"show_id":65025,"still_path":"/uuxrcuuVHbXEMRm8dLaecCpF3Dl.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5ba6579bc3a3680e6500c527","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1257703,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alastair Sooke","original_name":"Alastair Sooke","popularity":2.651,"profile_path":"/in8f8Xw38Sw8EUDiK5jZUssGUdc.jpg"},{"job":"Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5ba658300e0a2635f600cffb","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suniti Somaiya","original_name":"Suniti Somaiya","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5ba65825c3a3680e6500c5b9","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2132860,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Suniti Somaiya","original_name":"Suniti Somaiya","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-01-23","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"finale","id":1576371,"name":"A New Dawn","overview":"Alastair Sooke concludes the epic story of Egyptian art by looking at how, despite political decline, the final era of the Egyptian Empire saw its art enjoy revival and rebirth.
