Afterwards, Kimijima began appearing to her through the Iru-O network, threatening to reveal what she did along with Kaito and Akiho, forcing her to cooperate with his plan. Kimijima further states that he had threatened Airi in a similar manner and if it wasn't for Misaki's meddling, Project Atum would have occurred in 2015. Akiho questions Kimijima on whether Misaki still loves robots and he suggests that she still might, since she didn't stop playing Kill-Ballad. Akiho further vows that they will stop Kimijima and his plans using their giant robot and save Misaki whilst Sumio helps disarm Airi, who faints while Kimijima disappears.","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":46435,"still_path":"/klg1lCzCS6uERgyjaZfGX0hgj5G.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-03-15","episode_number":21,"episode_type":"standard","id":909752,"name":"Gunvarrel Takeoff!","overview":"Whilst everyone else works on fixing up the GunBuild-1, Kaito, Nae and Airi head to Kimijima's lab to retrieve data for the device Sawada gave him, although Kaito undergoes a seizure when he attempts to activate it. Just then, they are confronted by some armed droids run by Kimijima and Sister Centipede. However, Sister Centipede manages to have the droids shoot each other, only to be erased by Kimijima shortly afterwards. Meanwhile, as Akiho and the others complete the GunBuild-1, which she renames the Super GunBuild-1, she reunites with Ken'ichirō before learning of Kaito's condition. Despite his injuries, Kaito insists that he be Super GunBuild-1's operator, believing that the device Sawada gave him can trigger his Slow-Mo at will, giving him a chance against the Sumeragi. Akiho objects, however, believing using the device could kill him. Kaito assures her that he will help her meet Misa face-to-face again, giving her the Slow-Mo trigger.","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":46435,"still_path":"/2pMI4DyzPl3a3G7HZIELRS7XC80.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Animation Director","department":"Visual Effects","credit_id":"6096e0a6b39e35003e185e8f","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2498455,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Yasutaka Kubota","original_name":"Yasutaka Kubota","popularity":1.22,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-03-22","episode_number":22,"episode_type":"finale","id":909765,"name":"This is Our Game Now","overview":"Kaito arrives before Misaki, with the others helping to divert the missiles she fires using AR decoys, although Kaito is forced to use the Slow-Mo and sacrifice one of his pile bunkers to dodge the last one. Kaito manages to get up close to Misaki's Sumeragi and use the Slow-Mo to attack her with the other pile bunker. However, this knocks Misaki out and allows Kimijima to take full control of her as he divides the Sumeragi into a more mobile unit. After locking down the launch sequence, despite Nao and the other adults reclaming the control room, Kimijima launches an attack at the others forcing them to seperate, which leaves the Super Gunbuild-1 with only five minutes of power. Just then, Kona receives a program from Sawada that will erase Kimijima if they can get his avatar in the PokeCom's view, although it requires a reboot which leaves Kaito vulnerable.","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":46435,"still_path":"/hNJjj8sxBQosilo2FjhK75inoBn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Animation Director","department":"Visual Effects","credit_id":"6096e0a6b39e35003e185e8f","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2498455,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Yasutaka Kubota","original_name":"Yasutaka Kubota","popularity":1.22,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":54674,"poster_path":"/mTyHWhSg86Y7ENP2HSwKRAQT2Ig.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
