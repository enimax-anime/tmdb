The season is directly subsequent to Road Rules: All Stars.\n\nThe season marked the first time in which \"Real World/Road Rules Challenge\" would be used as the show's main title. In addition, it's one of two seasons absent of a subtitle, a trend that wouldn't truly emerge until the show's 4th season.\n\nIt is the first six-on-six Challenge in the series. The teams traveled via tour bus and RV starting in San Francisco, ending in Universal City, California, competing in different individual challenges. The winning team had the right to travel in a tour bus, while the losing team had to travel in an RV. Each time a team won an individual challenge, they won the right to spend time in a \"money machine\". The \"money machine\", set up outside Universal Studios Hollywood in Universal City, California was a huge wind chamber that contained up to $150,000. Whatever the casts could keep on them, they were guaranteed to keep. This season also featured an additional challenge where the two teams competed over possession of a teddy bear. Whichever team had the teddy bear in their possession at an unknown, predetermined point in the challenge, would win the additional challenge.",

Yes is asked how big his member is, Dan is asked who out of both teams he would like to go out with and he refuses to answer, Veronica is asked if she would be Amaya for a day and she quickly replies no, and lastly Amaya is asked if she would do the wrestling match over again and would she win. She basically said she'd kick Veronica's butt!!! The following day the teams are off to meet Gladys. She tells them their final mission would be skydiving, and reveals their handsome reward will not be money but brand new 2000 Nissan Xteras. The teams are excited and both want to win. They later find out they won't be diving tandem and they have to sign releases that warn them that they could be killed.",

Each time a team won an individual challenge, they won $10,000. After each mission won, the winning team would invest those 10K in the product of their choice through E-Trade. At the end, the winning team also won any money won in the stock market. The last mission would be for the right to keep the money collected in the pot, an additional cash prize and a car. This season also featured an additional challenge where the two teams had to give up smoking for the duration of filming. If any cast member on either team were caught smoking, their cast would lose the additional challenge.",

The teams traveled via tour bus in the eastern U.S. and Europe competing in different individual challenges. Each time a team won an individual challenge, money would be added to an E-Trade account.

The season is the second in the Gauntlet series, with the original Gauntlet airing in 2003–2004 and The Gauntlet III following in 2008.\n\nThe Gauntlet II aired in late 2005 and into 2006 with 32 contestants and took place in Trinidad and Tobago. The teams were designated Veterans and Rookies, based on the number of prior Challenge seasons on which each cast member had competed. Those on the Veterans team had been on at least two prior seasons, and those on the Rookies team had been on fewer than two seasons. For this season, a male and female captain were determined at the beginning of the season. After each team challenge, the losing team captain was sent to the \"Gauntlet\", where they would face an opponent of the same sex and same team who was voted into the Gauntlet by the respective team. Gauntlets alternated between \"Male Gauntlets\" and \"Female Gauntlets\".",

The surviving male and female cast member would win $150,000 each. The season was watched by a total of 83 million viewers. The Duel premiered on October 12, 2006, and concluded on January 18, 2007.\n\nThis is the first edition of The Duel series, with The Duel II following in 2009.",

This season featured the contestants \"stranded\" on an island off the coast of Panama, where the cast competed for a buried treasure chest filled with $300,000 USD in gold. Unlike in previous Challenges, the cast was not housed in a luxurious dwelling, but was \"forced\" to improvise and \"work\" for the basic necessities of food and shelter, as on the TV series Survivor. Unlike previous seasons of The Challenge, there were no predetermined teams. Instead, the cast members had to forge their own alliances. Of the twenty cast members, there were only four winners. The Island premiered on September 10, 2008, and concluded on October 29, 2008.",

In this unprecedented format, competitors will battle it out WITH and AGAINST their bloodlines, turning family into foe. This shake-up gets even more twisted when players learn that their fates are combined with their bloodlines'. It's anyone's game when family still means everything, because despite strong performances, competitors could still go home if their relatives fall short. With $350,000 on the line and family honor to defend, there will be blood. ",
