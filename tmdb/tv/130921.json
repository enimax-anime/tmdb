The judges - interior designers Anna Campbell Jones, architect Danny Campbell and Isle of Mull-based interior designer Banjo Beale - have travelled the country in search of Scotland’s Home of the Year. It’s now down to the final six homes – the winners of each regional episode – to go head-to-head. But only one of them can be the winner of the prestigious title.\n\nThe judges have invited the six regional winners to join them at Glasgow’s House for an Art Lover, designed by renowned architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Here, they will go through the homes one by one, assessing them on architectural merit, distinctive design and personal style, before whittling six down to three, and then – the hardest job of all – choosing the overall winner of Scotland’s Home of the Year 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, the finalists will get to meet the judges for the first time, meet one another, and cast their eyes over each other’s homes.",

In Falkirk, the judges climb to the top of a modern-day tower house designed by an architect for himself, his wife and their two children. Minimalist in style, accessories and decorative items are pared back, but there are plenty of considered design features to impress the judges. Last pitstop in this episode is Dunfermline where there's a funky vibe to a three-storey Georgian family home that embraces 1970s style with retro furniture with clashing prints and bold artworks.",

The judges - interior designers Anna Campbell Jones, architect Danny Campbell and Isle of Mull-based interior designer Banjo Beale - have travelled the country in search of Scotland’s Home of the Year. It’s now down to the final six homes – the winners of each regional episode – to go head-to-head. But only one of them can be the winner of the prestigious title.\n\nThe judges have invited the six regional winners to join them at Glasgow’s House for an Art Lover, designed by renowned architect Charles Rennie Mackintosh. Here, they will go through the homes one by one, assessing them on architectural merit, distinctive design and personal style, before whittling six down to three, and then – the hardest job of all – choosing the overall winner of Scotland’s Home of the Year 2024.\n\nMeanwhile, the finalists will get to meet the judges for the first time, meet one another, and cast their eyes over each other’s homes.",
