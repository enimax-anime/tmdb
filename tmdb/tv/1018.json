The real Candy, who had been assaulted at a hotel by the same man, is held in connection with the old woman's death.\n\nA woman named Kate is the only one who can back up Candy's alibi, but she has left town with her husband, who is the thief. Griff agrees to go after Kate and have her provide a statement. Only thing is, he discovers - as Ben and Joe do later - that she, too, has a past that, if revealed at trial, could do serious harm to Candy's defense.\n\nMeanwhile, Ben is unsure about the young defense attorney's ability to defend Candy, particularly since the state's attorney has a nearly spotless conviction record. But the budding lawyer is determined to play David to the prosecutor's Goliath.","production_code":"","runtime":49,"season_number":14,"show_id":1018,"still_path":"/bgiRqICgptzHFRKOynfuDzBymmY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Griff King","credit_id":"62ac80b334e15204691e8dc1","order":691,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Matheson","original_name":"Tim Matheson","popularity":23.504,"profile_path":"/trZ4QaDidCOPNy7HK9cYnmKHkg9.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1973-01-09","episode_number":15,"episode_type":"standard","id":983273,"name":"The Marriage of Theodora Duffy","overview":"A serious game of \"\"let's pretend\"\" begins when Griff and government agent Theodora Duffy pose as husband and wife to capture a gang of war criminals.","production_code":"","runtime":49,"season_number":14,"show_id":1018,"still_path":"/AwdMtg4SsmZrt3tJN2Ve4PmGd6l.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Theodora Duffy","credit_id":"6290b0e8cddbbc0e1aa9d381","order":597,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":92680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Carlson","original_name":"Karen Carlson","popularity":5.089,"profile_path":"/t5fT7xm6rO9PpanXztEhafVxlUY.jpg"},{"character":"Griff King","credit_id":"62ac80b334e15204691e8dc1","order":691,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21561,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tim Matheson","original_name":"Tim Matheson","popularity":23.504,"profile_path":"/trZ4QaDidCOPNy7HK9cYnmKHkg9.jpg"},{"character":"Hop Sing","credit_id":"6290b10d89b561009f1e9aea","order":854,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82385,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor Sen Yung","original_name":"Victor Sen Yung","popularity":2.997,"profile_path":"/6xFJCYYWmgvVzH6fx1vZXttqt7n.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1973-01-16","episode_number":16,"episode_type":"finale","id":983274,"name":"The Hunter","overview":"In what turned out to be the series finale, Little Joe is making a delivery for Ben when he meets Bill Tanner, a psychotic killer that is posing as a soldier he has killed.
