The Stratton mansion looks more like an arcade with video games lining the walls and a scale model train in the middle of the room that actually goes all over the property. Edward is totally taken by surprise when a blonde 12 year old boy arrives and introduces himself as Edward's son Ricky. Edward had been married to Ricky's mother Evelyn for seven days and until that moment he had no clue that he was a father. We meet Edward's assistant Kate Summers during a thoughtful moment of her mentioning that perhaps Edward should hold off on a charity donation until his finances were back in shape. After discovering and proving that Lou had really embezzled Edward's money, Ricky tries to convince his father to let him move in with him instead of making him return to military school.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":2076,"still_path":"/5Ghmv1l3zluy67iUSIgbMTc0ESv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525720c3760ee3776a1ffa36","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1228401,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Ron Leavitt","original_name":"Ron Leavitt","popularity":2.681,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525720be760ee3776a1ff2c3","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212691,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David W.
