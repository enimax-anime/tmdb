The dead man is Declan Roach, a researcher at the local university who was found in a university laboratory clean room. The autopsy confirms that he died from nitrogen intoxication but it is not clear at first if it was accidental or not. Roach was working under the direction of Professor Fran Cunningham, who in turn has a major contract with Aphrodite, a major cosmetics firm. She is working on a formula for a rejuvenation cream that will be nothing less than a fountain of youth and there is obviously a great deal of money at stake.

Dalziel's distinctly unhappy. He cannot forgive Fitzgerald for losing a recent court case against local villain and long standing adversary Danny Macer. He's even angrier when Macer turns up to celebrate, but anger turns to suspicion when Fitzgerald's found dead on a golf course the following morning.\n\nAs the team examine Fitzgerald's soured personal life, including his affair with physiotherapist Rachel Waller, Dalziel goes after Macer. Pascoe tries to keep the investigation on course, but Dalziel's obsession soon leads him into confrontation with both Pascoe and his boss. ACC Stella Applegarth orders him back off duty on grounds of ill-health. Pascoe takes over, but soon finds evidence - a key leading to a bank vault and a suitcase full of money - which suggests that Dalziel's instincts about Fitzgerald may have been right.\n\nAs Pascoe
