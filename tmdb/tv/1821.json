The title refers to his attempt, 'straight' being a slang term meaning being honest, in contrast to 'bent', i.e., dishonest.\n\nAlso re-appearing was Richard Beckinsale as Lennie Godber, who was Fletcher's na√Øve young cellmate and was now in a relationship with his daughter Ingrid. Her brother Raymond was played by a teenage Nicholas Lyndhurst.\n\nOnly one series, of six episodes, was made in 1978. It attracted an audience of over 15 million viewers and won a BAFTA award in March 1979, but hopes of a further series had already been dashed by Beckinsale's premature death earlier in the same month.","popularity":4.237,"poster_path":"/mOY12FFE5Lzau0raQ1Vum3dAC0O.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1978-02-24","episode_count":6,"id":5162,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/ufJt6Le9PuAhmupMmZB3maVGbUt.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":14,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5257160f760ee3776a13d6a2","air_date":"1978-02-24","episodes":[{"air_date":"1978-02-24","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":110216,"name":"Going Home","overview":"Fletch has now reached the end of his stay in Prison and says his goodbyes to McLaren.
