Watch your boy, Eddie Huang, in the moments where the cameras shouldn't have been rolling. Can't wait to see you next season!",

From high-powered meetings with the pandas of Chengdu and pasta with self-proclaimed celebrity gangster Dave Courtney, we ask the people on the ground whether the changes we're seeing and the progress we've been promised are actually helping the every day man in his pursuit of happiness. Of course, this all happens through the lens of food, across a table, on a plate. Fuck with the kid.",
