It's a role reversal for Bear Grylls in this adventure series. Instead of himself attempting to survive harsh conditions in a remote location, Grylls abandons groups of British men and women on remote, uninhabited Pacific islands for a month and more. They will be completely alone, filming themselves, and with only the clothes they're wearing and some basic tools. The island may look like paradise but behind the beaches it can be hell on earth. When stripped of all the luxuries and conveniences of 21st-century living, does modern British man still have the spirit and resources to survive?",
