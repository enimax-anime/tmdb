In January, a judge sentenced him to 5 days in jail and gave him a few months to clean his property, or face a fine and additional jail time. Just days before the deadline Paul must make a decision; allow the tow trucks and metal collectors to descend on his property and clear out his collection, or go to jail. Missy is a hoarder with a 7 year old son, Alex, who has begun to exhibit hoarding tendencies. On several occasions when she has tried to clean, her son has cried hysterically over things like a rusty chain and an old used cotton ball. Unless she can set an example, Alex will continue to follow her behavior and may never have a shot at a normal life. Now Missy must clean up her house in order to save her son.",

Judy needs to clean up before she ends up homeless. Jerry used to have a lovely half million dollar property in a very desirable neighborhood. He lived there with his kids until his hoarding got so bad that the kids were forced to move in with their grandparents. Then the house went up in flames due to arson. Now, the burned out shell of his home is surrounded by a giant junkyard. It's a huge eye-sore and a public nuisance that will be taken by the city if he doesn't clean up.",

Bonnie is a 46-year-old single mother of two teenage daughters, neither of whom can remember ever having a clean house. The home is hoarded and in need of repair, but Bonnie is terrified C.P.S. will take her kids away if she lets anyone in.

Ever since Linda's husband died ten years ago, she has been adding to a hoard that has now spiraled out of control. Her two grown sons living with her do nothing about it either and each family member blames the other for not cleaning--causing a toxic three-way in the house. If Linda doesn't get help with the hoarding so she can recuperate and rehab from her future surgery, her sister is threatening to report her to the authorities and will have her own sister \"shut-down.\"",

If the mortgage company came for an inspection, they could determine an unresolvable fault in payment and then take the house from Andy and his mother, leaving them homeless. Now with the help of the Hoarders team of experts, Andy will clean up the property or lose everything",
