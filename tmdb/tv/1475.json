But after a near-fatal car accident puts him in a deep coma, Johnny awakens six years later to find everything has changed: Sarah is now is married to someone else, local sheriff Walt Bannerman; the child they are raising is actually Johnny's son and knows nothing about his real father; and Johnny's mother Vera has passed away, leaving Johnny's finances under the thumb of Reverend Purdy, an influential religious leader who is also his mother's former lover. But, most importantly, Johnny himself has changed: he now finds himself with the gift (or curse) of second sight. Through visions he sees with a simple touch, he becomes responsible for saving a nurse's little girl from a fire, helping his Vietnamese doctor reunite with the mother he thought was killed during the fall of Saigon, and now must prevent a local serial killer from striking again. Now Johnny is faced with the daunting task of coming to grips with his new powers - and navigating his way through his new life.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":1475,"still_path":"/jmsADORrXLe7EqCV2vA4PWQ3Bjj.jpg","vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52570664760ee3776a0230af","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Lieberman","original_name":"Rob Lieberman","popularity":3.32,"profile_path":"/lPaofAC7evfyLsS1lgbW2DlVwmD.jpg"},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5dacd18eae3668001299c052","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2514,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Piller","original_name":"Michael Piller","popularity":1.597,"profile_path":"/gRVdvhnkO93FBIq4GuIWcw5scmD.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"52570664760ee3776a023101","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":158356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Campbell Lane","original_name":"Campbell Lane","popularity":2.346,"profile_path":"/qK8GdBBGLnVZf1TKD7Sghq1gc0H.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"52570664760ee3776a023127","order":557,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1176922,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gina Chiarelli","original_name":"Gina Chiarelli","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/qmPAx60VQWh0YTrbY9ZS8XgI6iZ.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"52570664760ee3776a02314d","order":600,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Holmes","original_name":"Emily Holmes","popularity":5.735,"profile_path":"/251GyvALh5NiorRIwvn1oLgVmI6.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"52570665760ee3776a023173","order":624,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62869,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alvin Sanders","original_name":"Alvin Sanders","popularity":4.128,"profile_path":"/aATeiW7OlEwAM22NDW9uzo0GXTX.jpg"},{"character":"Gene Purdy","credit_id":"52570665760ee3776a023199","order":648,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ogden Stiers","original_name":"David Ogden Stiers","popularity":11.625,"profile_path":"/cgCTQt3RZVkhkusG77l4HwHEH6A.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2002-06-23","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":70069,"name":"What It Seems (2)","overview":"With the help of his new friend Bruce, Johhny attempts to stop the Bangor Strangler from claiming another victim.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":1475,"still_path":"/qNfNsUXAUnoJmjc2RKyyhLmLmOw.jpg","vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52570664760ee3776a0230af","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27146,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rob Lieberman","original_name":"Rob Lieberman","popularity":3.32,"profile_path":"/lPaofAC7evfyLsS1lgbW2DlVwmD.jpg"},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5dacd18eae3668001299c052","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2514,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Piller","original_name":"Michael Piller","popularity":1.597,"profile_path":"/gRVdvhnkO93FBIq4GuIWcw5scmD.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"52570664760ee3776a02314d","order":600,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":37979,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Emily Holmes","original_name":"Emily Holmes","popularity":5.735,"profile_path":"/251GyvALh5NiorRIwvn1oLgVmI6.jpg"},{"character":"Gene Purdy","credit_id":"52570665760ee3776a023199","order":648,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ogden Stiers","original_name":"David Ogden Stiers","popularity":11.625,"profile_path":"/cgCTQt3RZVkhkusG77l4HwHEH6A.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2002-06-30","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":70070,"name":"Quality of Life","overview":"Johnny returns to his old school as a substitute teacher and as a hockey coach.

Trapped in a web of fate where anything he does will make things worse, Johnny ends up provoking a fight with Kate and she dies and Jason lives, as he foresaw . . . but Jason learns from the experience.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":2,"show_id":1475,"still_path":"/8VK5lr0zFhRHx7TnzM2WOpvQDRg.jpg","vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257067a760ee3776a0240b7","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":31900,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Vejar","original_name":"Michael Vejar","popularity":2.019,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257066d760ee3776a0236c5","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1224801,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Benz","original_name":"David Benz","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52570672760ee3776a023a5b","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224804,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Craig Silverstein","original_name":"Craig Silverstein","popularity":2.453,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"5257067a760ee3776a02402f","order":541,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":55554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Kapelos","original_name":"John Kapelos","popularity":10.613,"profile_path":"/9buu5iq8FxJXMqMjmqEjm1zl2A6.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"5257067a760ee3776a024055","order":577,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58058,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lochlyn Munro","original_name":"Lochlyn Munro","popularity":22.298,"profile_path":"/nTtzCBFYTEnYCS7CqUwxtC6OsXD.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"5257067a760ee3776a02407b","order":619,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12851,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ally Sheedy","original_name":"Ally Sheedy","popularity":23.864,"profile_path":"/f6fg7E7lcMiPVDywUcsVd3PiXvo.jpg"},{"character":"Gene Purdy","credit_id":"52570665760ee3776a023199","order":648,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ogden Stiers","original_name":"David Ogden Stiers","popularity":11.088,"profile_path":"/cgCTQt3RZVkhkusG77l4HwHEH6A.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2003-04-06","episode_number":12,"episode_type":"standard","id":70092,"name":"Zion","overview":"Johnny goes the funeral of Bruce's father and somehow gives Bruce visions of what Bruce's life would have been like if he had never met Johnny.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":2,"show_id":1475,"still_path":"/z6WLXd0ZXI8ElDIbzaNEowzUA5Y.jpg","vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52570667760ee3776a0233f9","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1197474,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Robison","original_name":"Michael Robison","popularity":4.861,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52570667760ee3776a0233d1","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219351,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joe Menosky","original_name":"Joe Menosky","popularity":1.062,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5dacd18eae3668001299c052","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2514,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Piller","original_name":"Michael Piller","popularity":2.236,"profile_path":"/gRVdvhnkO93FBIq4GuIWcw5scmD.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"5257067a760ee3776a0240e9","order":542,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Gossett Jr.","original_name":"Louis Gossett Jr.","popularity":14.525,"profile_path":"/27SplfxhM8Do78mYOyi43t1G3fy.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"5257067a760ee3776a02410f","order":592,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":80348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lorena Gale","original_name":"Lorena Gale","popularity":4.092,"profile_path":"/pTPTOCMpaOiunlZvZ2W4UUCpDgB.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"5257067a760ee3776a02413b","order":635,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":58908,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Carrie Fleming","original_name":"Carrie Fleming","popularity":2.482,"profile_path":"/k4lZO5dXqnZ2Q9yTgHN9hc1r1wx.jpg"},{"character":"Gene Purdy","credit_id":"52570665760ee3776a023199","order":648,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28010,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Ogden Stiers","original_name":"David Ogden Stiers","popularity":11.088,"profile_path":"/cgCTQt3RZVkhkusG77l4HwHEH6A.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"5257067a760ee3776a024161","order":655,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20221,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nathaniel DeVeaux","original_name":"Nathaniel DeVeaux","popularity":2.524,"profile_path":"/3TdprDSOpurRTbXDfNUE5ZRUwww.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2003-07-06","episode_number":13,"episode_type":"standard","id":70093,"name":"The Storm","overview":"In the aftermath of Kate's death, Johnny's friends stage an intervention to shake him out of his guilt, but as Bruce drives him to Purdy's lakeside resort, he senses a storm is brewing.
