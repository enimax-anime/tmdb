    "overview": "As a professional billiards player, Yin Guo has become quite a notable athlete. After receiving an invitation to play in a tournament in Hel, Yin Guo eagerly accepts. Little does she know that what will follow will change her life forever.\n\nBefore Yin Guo can even start training for the upcoming competition, an unexpected snowstorm leaves her stranded with Lin Yi Yang, and an instant connection is made. Helped along by her cousin, Yin Guo and Yi Yang continue to get to know each other better long after the storm subsides. But even as they draw closer, Yin Guo has no idea that Yi Yang has quite a bit of history in the world of professional billiards. A true genius in the sport, Yi Yang once basked in the spotlight of professional billiards fame, but that was a long time ago.\n\nInspired by Yin Guo’s love of the sport, Yi Yang decides the time is right to return to the world of professional billiards.\n\n(Source: Viki)",
