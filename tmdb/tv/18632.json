When Theresa meets Gabe, a silver fox of a trumpet player, Cyn is put out that Theresa's flirting with him. Meanwhile, Cyn has her driving test tomorrow - fourth time lucky! Tipsy, Theresa says people learn to drive after they've passed their test, and that if Cyn had someone else to take her test for her she would be fine. Gabe stays over, and Theresa feels great - it's usually Cyn who's the wild one, but with Gabe she feels twenty years younger.\n\nLater on, Cyn rings: she failed her test again, and wants Theresa to come round. Theresa lets slip that Gabe stayed. Cyn is quietly furious. Eventually, Cyn tells Theresa that Gabe is a wife beater. Theresa's devastated - she's had trouble with men before, but thought Gabe was different. Cyn reassures Theresa that she is there for her, and brings up the subject of her driving test... Cyn dyes and styles Theresa's hair to match her own. Theresa tries to voice her doubts, but Cyn rides rough shod over them. The plan works, and Theresa passes the test. Cyn's elated: the first thing she's going to do is take her out to the seaside. Theresa grips the seat as Cyn almost loses control of the car.\n\nOn the way home, Gabe calls. Cyn's furious that Theresa is even speaking to him, but for some reason Theresa hears him out. When Theresa finds out that the allegations are completely false, Cyn crashes the car and ends up in hospital. Cyn begs Theresa not to tell the police, but Theresa realises that Cyn can't be trusted. Cyn is furious: how could Theresa do that to her after 50 years of friendship?",

Bugsy has a regular morning ritual with a couple of local kids, Dylan and Josh, who jump on the back of the float for a ride. Bugsy shouts at them because that's expected, but he doesn't actually mind. He even swerves in the street a little to increase the thrill for them. But this time Dylan falls off and bangs his head - there's a brief moment of dizziness, and then Dylan gets up and runs off laughing.\n\nBugsy worries about Dylan and takes him a big bar of chocolate. Dylan's estranged dad Clive gives him a thump for his troubles, but single mum Ally tends to his injuries. Ally's touched by Bugsy's concern for her son - she knows the accident was Dylan's fault. According to her posh new neighbours Dylan's got ADHD, but they are middle class snobs; he's just a boy, full of beans.\n\nThere's a definite spark between Bugsy and Ally, but Ally is just about to take her ex Clive back into her home; her area is being gentrified, she can't afford the rent by herself, and she thinks she's doing the right thing by the boys. Ally's mum Rita thinks she'd be better off suing the dairy for compensation, then she wouldn't need to take Clive back, but Ally doesn't want to do it. Bugsy was so innocent and nice and vulnerable. He came to see them out of kindness. And he got battered for his trouble. But on the other hand...\n\nBugsy's boss tears strips off him and moves him to another milk round - Ally thinks that Bugsy's been sacked and goes to see him. Bugsy's touched by her concern and tells Ally that he won't say anything to jeopardise her compensation, even if it costs him his job. Ally decides she owes it to Bugsy to tell him a few home truths...",

When it turns out that there are rats in the house Caroline reaches breaking point, but Maggie calms her and puts her in touch with her husband's mate Sam, a rat catcher. Sam says it's going to take several weeks to get on top of the problem, as he doesn't want to put poison down with a baby in the house. He takes pity on Caroline's predicament; he can see how hard things are for her, and he unwittingly starts to take the place of Tom in the household - at the dinner table, with the baby, doing odd jobs about the house.\n\nThe attraction is clearly growing between Sam and Caroline, but they both resist. When there's a health scare with the baby Sam is a rock for Caroline, but even when he stays over he's on the sofa. However, Maggie is suspicious of the dramatic change in Caroline's outlook and gossip starts to spread. Caroline is snubbed by the wives at a memorial service and her protests at innocence are scoffed at.\n\nChastened by the priest's sermon about sacrifice and duty, Caroline goes to find Sam to tell him that they can't be friends any more, only to find that he has been beaten up as a warning. Caroline's heart goes out to Sam, and they end up in bed confessing their love for each other. They are interrupted by a phone call...",

Billy has had to sell his van to pay off debts, and is getting by on small plumbing jobs. Even then Billy can't help himself - he gambles the money a customer gave him for parts, and ends up having to steal a pair of taps from the betting shop toilets to complete the job. Even his mate Dave won't lend him any money - he's on the ropes.\n\nWhilst pricing up a job one day, Billy stumbles across what looks like a small bag of diamonds hidden in the loft. Billy has no idea whether they're real or not, but as house owner June isn't aware of the stash, Billy takes one to show the more worldly-wise Dave. They're both gob-smacked when the gems turn out to be real.\n\nBilly isn't sure he wants to get involved, but there are bills to be paid and Dave eggs him on. Billy takes a few of the gemstones and splits the money with Dave. For a while he's flush - but instead of paying off his debts immediately, Billy tries to make his windfall larger at the betting shop, and it's not long before he is back at square one.\n\nThe final demands are getting more insistent, and Billy has no other option but to go back to June's for more diamonds. When he fritters that money away as well, Billy gets desperate and takes Michelle's house-keeping money to try and win money from his friends at cards. At his lowest ebb, Billy returns to June's - only to discover that he's in even more trouble than he thought...\n\nWith Dave on the next flight to Spain, and Michelle packing her bags, Billy is at his wit's end when there's a knock at the door. When will Billy face up to his addiction?",

She's been with Andy for over two years, but there's still no stork on the horizon.\n\nWhen Christina starts behaving strangely, Andy's suspicious of an affair - but it turns out that gay best friend Mick has been accompanying Christina on fertility tests. Andy's surprised - he didn't think Christina was really that keen on kids, and he reluctantly confesses that he's infertile. Christina's devastated - she loves Andy, but she knows if she stays with him that she'll never be a mother. Mick points out that there are other ways of having kids - she could always adopt or foster - but Christina says it's not the same; she wants her own child.\n\nAndy tells Christina he'd do anything to be with her, and Christina decides she's found the perfect sperm donor - Mick! Andy struggles with the idea; deep down, he would always know that the baby wasn't his. It's not like he could just forget about it, because he'd have to face the real father the whole time. But he reluctantly goes along with it for Christina's sake.\n\nMick and his boyfriend Frank are gob-smacked when the subject is broached. Mick is genuinely shocked by the request but says he'll think about it. The request opens up a can of worms in Mick and Frank's relationship, and they end up arguing. Christina is on tenterhooks waiting for a response, and is disappointed when Mick finally says no.

Long-suffering of each other's foibles, but always leavened with fond humour, relations are nevertheless strained by their failure to sell their house, which has been on the market for months. As they bicker about reducing the price, they are unaware that two other arguments are happening simultaneously on their street; a young couple, Sarah and Ryan, argue about money, and taxi passenger Dave complains about the fare to driver Neil. These events come to a terrible head when Ryan is fatally knocked over by Neil, outside John and Carol's house. John and Carol try to be as sensitive as they can to the mourners congregating outside their house, but as the weeks turn into months, and the shrine of flowers, cards and soft toys encroaches ever further into their lives, even John and Carol's ever-present humour starts to fade.",

She is pulled in so many directions that she has little time to think of herself, and even less opportunity to build a meaningful relationship. A chance encounter with supply teacher Aiden ignites a spark that offers Liv a real chance of the happiness and love she deserves. But Liv has a secret that threatens to ruin everything. Once a week, after dropping the boys at school, Liv dutifully travels to the prison where her father Kris is serving a lengthy sentence. These visits have dominated her life since the kids were small, and although she tries to protect them from this grim reality, they know more than she realises.",
