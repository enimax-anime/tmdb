Richard throws a barbecue to try to borrow money from his neighbors to pay off the $20,000 he owes. When Sid finds he is missing a one hundred-dollar bill, Karen thinks it is merely coincidental. When Laura's father, who's visiting from out of town, lends them the money, Richard is relieved. After Karen worries that Diana is spending too much time with her boyfriend, the boyfriend turns out to be the thief of the hundred-dollar bill.",

Val agrees that she won't if Gary will only see Abby at KLMotors during normal working hours. Knowing this, Abby deliberately sets up a meeting at night, and convinces Gary he has to be there. Gary goes, so Val signs the publishing contract. Richard's boss tells him to set up another client party with prostitutes. Unaware that she's taping him, Richard tells a prostitute that his company is only using him as a pimp. The tape is played on the news, and his boss releases a statement that hiring the prostitutes was all Richard's idea and they had no knowledge of it. He then fires Richard.",

Chip and Bess have an argument and she breaks up with him and fires him. Chip tells Lilimae that he quit over policy differences and lost his lease, so Lilimae invites him to live with her and Val.

Val overhears Chip telling Lilimae that Gary is cheating with Ciji (Chip is lying.).Gary tells Abby they need to talk, because they're hurting too many people. Abby promises to set aside time, but doesn't. Gary considers having a drink. Everything's going wrong with the details for Mac and Karen's wedding, so they sneak out of the rehearsal and go to Las Vegas. They get married at \"\"The Bridal Veil Chapel\"\".

Lilimae tries to convince both Chip and Diana to testify that he killed Ciji, because he has to pay for his crime. Janet tells Lilimae that since Chip won't confess and Diana won't testify, they don't have enough to hold Chip and he'll be released the next day. Lilimae decides to try and talk to him one last time, and brings Karen to talk to Diana. As they pull up, Chip has already been released and is talking to reporters.

Laura gets Westmont drunk to see what Abby's up to, and he tells her about H & O. Gary receives his inheritance. Diana gives a deposition that Chip 'accidentally' killed Ciji, but then he wakes up from the coma. The police handcuff him to the bed. The police decide to move Chip to County Hospital, but when they go to his room to get him, he's gone.",

Gary sees that Cathy makes much more than the other ranch hands, and that they are dated from before he met her. Gary hires a detective who says Cathy spent the last 4 years in prison. Ben and Mac discover that Apaloon owns all the property at Lotus point except for Abby and Karen's apartment. They think Apaloon is a front for Wolfbridge. Greg and Laura sleep together. Karen suffers from withdrawal. Gary goes to see her and says if he could get through it, she can. Karen is outraged that he would compare her plight with his alcoholism. Karen finally opens up in group. Karen's therapist wants Mac in on her therapy too. Mac feels they're ganging up on him. Ben tells Val to tell people that the baby is Gary's, as he's tired of everyone bugging him about it, and he wants to be free of her.",

Mack barges into Abby's office, but she denies knowing anything. She tells Westmont if Gary finds out and sues her she would win.

Ben tells Val that Gary is dead. Karen tells Val that Gary is alive, but kidnapped. Val confronts Ben, who says he was happy when he thought Gary was dead, because he's tired of her being in love with him. Val breaks up with him. Mac has Gary stashed away at the Bel Mar motel, and brings Abby to see Gary. Gary's mad at her and doesn't like Mac's plan as it depends on Abby. Mac says he has no choice. Greg calls a press conference and says that he found out Wolfbridge is a criminal organization, and gives credit to Mac. Greg says he will sever all ties with them. Mac tells Abby he is going to wire her, and will bring Gary out to the lobby at 3:30 so that St. Claire will have a chance to shoot Gary again. Abby needs to get him to say something that will link him to the assassination attempt and then get away from him as fast as she can.",

Greg wakes up and Galveston is in his room and says that he is dying and it's time for him to forgive and forget. Galveston says his money has more power than being a senator, and Greg craves power. Greg tells Laura his divorce is final. People mob the station wanting to see Joshua, so Abby gives him a regular segment on Reverend Kathryn's show. The detective reports to Abby on Val, but Abby tells everyone he has no leads since Nevada. In Shula, Val goes to a \"\"social\"\" with Parker, but walks out when people tell her he has a girlfriend. Parker tells Val that they broke up, and he kisses her.",

Val meanwhile tries to break down the door. Mac says he'll get a court order so the Fisher's can't leave, but the Judge won't grant it until there's more evidence. Mac stations men outside their house. Val refuses to leave, so Ben   waits with her. He tells Val that Karen believed her all along, and worked for months to find the babies. Val's upset that no one told her they believed her. Harry arrives home with a police escort, who tell Val she has to leave. She loses it.

Mac has Karen bring Val to the hospital to get the birth records, but the clerk says there are no records of the twins. Abby tells Gary that there was a call from Southfork and Bobby i",

Abby overhears Laura telling this to Karen, and she asks Peter out for a drink. Gary decides to go into racing. Karen finds Jill's hotel key in Mac's pocket and confronts him with it. He tries to explain that he would never use it, but it made him feel younger, more alive, like life wasn't passing him by, and he hopes Karen will understand. Crying, she says no. Mac's upset that Jill went through his Westfall file without permission. Sonny accidentally drops a tape marked \"\"Cathy #3\"\". Val plays the tape, and hears Sonny's notes about his articles. Meanwhile, Sonny is out to dinner with Cathy. She tells him how Joshua tried to throw her off of the roof, and that Lilimae saved her life. Sonny says he's sorry for what Joshua did to her.",

Greg tells Laura that he wants Peter in politics, because then he will be back in politics. Peter's resistant, so Greg says if he will run, he will publicly acknowledge him as his brother and give him a big settlement. Greg also stops Sylvia's monthly check. Abby also tells Peter to accept Greg's offer, and she sleeps with him. Mac is worried when Karen misses lunch and he can't locate her. Ben tells Cathy he will go on tour with her, and Cathy is excited. He tells Val, who is stunned. Val tries to talk him out of it, and is scared he is leaving her. Ben assures her it is only for 6 weeks, and he really needs the time away to think about things. Lilimae is angry at Cathy and slaps her. Ben leaves. Paige Matheson shows up at the MacKenzies. When Mac gets home, she says \"\"I've wanted to meet you for a long time. I'm your daughter.\"\" Paige has arrived.",

Later Phil is indicted, and asks Mac to lie on the stand, but Mac says he can't.   The polls begin to shift in Gary's favor. Peter decides to use married Gary's affair with Jill against him, although they've decided to hold off until after the election. Mac has a phony story released that they found the kidnapper's fingerprints and know who he is. This makes Phil very nervous, and Greg figures out that he is the kidnapper. Greg confronts him and gives him one day to undo the situation. Phil pours gasoline all over the house and lights a match. As the house starts to go up in flames, Karen discovers a trap door to the attic.",

Al proposes to Lilimae, who says she can't leave Val. Finally, Lilimae tells Al she won't marry him, but will live with him. They buy a motorhome and leave Knots Landing. Gary spends lots of time with Val and the twins. They laugh about how everyone thinks they're having an affair. Abby tells Jill that Gary and Val are using the twins as an excuse to see one another, and that Jill no longer excites Gary because the cheating excites him, not the woman. Abby waits at a restaurant for Charles, but then his secretary calls and says he's overseas. She remembers trashing her room after she left Charles, and vowing that she would never let a man hurt her again. Greg misses Laura terribly, and tells Meg about all the things they'll do together when she's back. Then he gets a call from the clinic that Laura is dead.",

Val is furious that Karen didn't tell her Laura was dying, and she goes off and screams at everyone that they all treat her like she can't handle anything, but she has news for them - she can. She rejects Karen's attempts to talk to her. She later talks to Gary, who is miserable that he always screws up everything in his life. Abby slams everybody to the maid. Mack gets a little drunk and makes unintentionally funny remarks that crack everyone up. Greg and Mac go to pick out a casket. Greg sees an old man who can't afford a nice casket for his wife, so Greg tells the mortician he'll pay for the woman to have a top-of-the-line funeral. Mack confronts Greg on his lack of emotion, and Greg is offended.",

Judith secretly tapes Abby, and tells Charles that Abby used inside information. Charles says he doesn't care - he loves Abby. Michael fends off Jody's advances and tells her he doesn't love her. She's very upset. The MacKenzies have the Williams over for dinner, and Frank acts strange. Mack is sure Frank is a cop. It's too late for Gary to appeal for paternal rights to the twins, so Jill draws up an official sounding letter for Val to sign, naming Gary as the twins' father. Val's upset and decides to get her own attorney. When Gary comes to visit, Val goes off, screaming that he is not the twins' dad, and to never come back.",

The MacKenzies are suspicious of the Williams' and speculate that Frank and Pat don't have custody of Julie. They see a woman come and pick Pat up in the middle of the night. Karen and Mack tell the truth in their depositions, and convince Val to tell the truth, that Gary wants visitation, not custody. Charles suggests to Abby she expands the marina at Lotus Point. He loans her the money, not telling her he is the front for investors. Charles gives her plans he had drawn up, but Abby finds they were made before he came back into her life. She hires a detective to investigate him. Charles' divorce is final, so Abby wants to get married ASAP.",

The MacKenzies wonder if Greg is ever going to pick up Meg. Val tells Gary he won't get custody of the twins. Abby tells Charles that Lotus Point can't afford to expand the marina. Charles says it will be her wedding gift, and gives her a check for $2 million. Abby and Charles get married in Lake Tahoe. The next day, Abby has her attorney annul the marriage, and tells Charles she knows he only wanted Lotus Point. He admits he did, but then fell in love with her. Charles wants his money back, but Abby has already cleared the check. His investors tell him to just let her have it to avoid publicity. Charles goes back east. Abby is really upset, and Olivia gives Abby her wedding gift - a star she had named after them.",

The MacKenzies are very upset and miss Meg terribly when Greg brings her home. Greg builds a playhouse for Meg, but realizes how tough it will be to raise her. Upset, he brings Meg back to the MacKenzies and asks them to be Meg's parents. He wants them to tell Meg about Laura, but says he will stay out of their life. Seeing how upset Mack and Karen are without Meg, Val has a change of heart. She signs the paper saying Gary is the twins' father. She gives it to him and says she knows he loves them, and would want him to raise them if anything ever happened to her. He says she's a good mother and rips the paper up. They hug.",

Jill undresses him and messes up the bed. She calls Gary, then tells the hotel operator to hold her calls until the next morning. Jill flies back to Los Angeles and dons another disguise.

The Federales stop the bus and take Paige, Michael and Chavas. Abby and Gary fill all the slips in the marina so that Manny can't dock his boat. Manny calls Karen and says she'd better do something about it if she wants Paige and Michael to return safely from Mexico. Jill, in disguise, surprises Val. She says the letters and calls from Ben were a hoax, and she had the forger write a suicide note for Val that says Val found out Ben is dead. Julie and Frank come to the door, and Val nervously says she has to stay home because Betsy's sick. Frank remarks to Pat that Val acted strangely, like she was being held at gunpoint. Jill forces Val to take sleeping pills saying if she doesn't, she'll shoot Val, and it's better if the twins find her asleep rather than with her brains splattered all over the room. Val pleads with her, and Jill says she's sick of everyone calling her",

Mack gets the Williams' dental records and calls a reporter friend. A story appears in the paper that Federal Witness Dr. Sollars and her family died in a car crash in Seattle, so they won't have to live in hiding anymore. Karen and Gary take Val to the hotel in San Francisco where Jill stayed. They question employees who recognize Jill's photo, but no one saw her after 8:00pm. Val says Jill could've flown back, but Gary doesn't believe her. He cuddles Val and says she'll get through this. Jill is upset that Gary went with Val, and tells him no one saw her after 8:00 because she had a one-night-stand.",

Anne replies, \"\"Yeah, and I'm the Queen of England!\"\" Greg tells Abby their marriage will be a political one, since they can go twice as far together.

Jill spies on Gary and orders invitations for her and Gary's wedding. David Lamb bursts into Jill's office and says she is a slut who gave him VD. The Health Dept. calls both Jill and Gary to say that they have been exposed to Syphilis. Jill makes her appointment right before Gary's and tells the doctor they're getting married. Gary overhears nurse ask Jill if she wants another prescription. Gary calls the doctor and says Jill wants another prescription, and he'd like the insurance transcript. He discovers it was for barbiturates, and was filled before Jill went to San Francisco. The doctor tells Gary that neither he nor Jill has an STD. Gary thinks it's strange that Jill didn't get VD from David, and tells Mack he thinks Val may be telling the truth.",

Jill continues breaking into the ranch, so Gary bursts into her office and screams to get out of his life. The Police later serve Gary with a restraining order. Jill runs into the twins at the library, and when Val finds out she barges into Jill's office and trashes it. Val screams at Jill to stay away from her and grabs a scissors. Scared Val will stab her, she runs from the office. Hearing Jill saw the twins, Gary rushes to Jill's apartment. Val goes to Jill's and tries to calm Gary down. They walk over to a park to talk. Driving home, Gary is pulled over by the police. They open his trunk. Jill is in the trunk - bound, gagged, and dead.",

Karen shows up at Mac's office in an overcoat and lingerie. She starts to do a striptease, then an old couple walks in, and she runs out, embarrassed. Michael and some friends go to a cabin for the weekend, and he is jealous when he sees Ellen and Johnny together. Later he talks over his women problems with a sympathetic park ranger, Paula. She tells him she'll be giving ecology lectures at his college. Olivia tells Abby she is going with Michael, but instead stays with Harold, who rejects her advances. He wants to wait until they are married. Val and Gary go out. Julie helps Frank and Pat make up after a fight.",

Gary and Sally's friend decide to meet at a store. He hears her but then the twins run up to him with Val and Danny. Abby's Morikame atty., Rick Hawkins, tells Abby she didn't get the oil permits, and if her former partners find out she owns Morikame, she could be imprisoned for fraud. She asks Rick to predate her documents, but not to tell Ted. Abby then sleeps with Ted and asks him to pose as Morikame's owner, and she'll give him half the oil profits. Ted agrees, and they sign the papers. Abby wants the original documents, but Rick says he shredded them. Paige snoops at Abby's and then tells Rick that Ted and Abby are setting him up. Rick later sends some documents to Paige at Sumner Group, but Abby throws them away. Rick is dead in his bathtub, electrocuted by a hairdryer.",

Ted hot wires a truck and follows her. Paige gets a flat tire, so she pulls into a garage to have it fixed. She hides the documents in the towel holder and jumps out the window as Ted breaks in. Greg is there too, so Paige throws the empty envelope at Ted. He takes off in the truck. Paige retrieves the real papers after Greg leaves. They stop in the road where tow trucks are pulling Ted's truck out of a lake. They think Ted drowned, but he hasn't. He flags down a car to drive him back to town.",

Ginny takes the twins to see her friend Jeri at her office at Oakman Industries. While there, Jeri steals $17,000, and Ginny is arrested as an accessory. Oakman's attorney, Mark Baylor tells Mac they won't prosecute Jeri if she returns the money. Jeri refuses because they dissolved her pension, and says she'll only return the money if all pensions are restored. Mac thinks it's fishy that Oakman doesn't want to prosecute. Then Jeri is found splattered on the sidewalk below her apartment window.",

Tom calls Oakman and says he's dating her because Mac's back on the case. Tom tells Mac he overheard that a man named Pomerantz has evidence against Oakman. Amanda, who is a wreck, quits her job and avoids Gary. Danny doesn't understand why Amanda's so upset, and he brings Chester back. Linda announces that she and Eric are divorcing, and kisses Michael, which freaks him out. Karen becomes the permanent host of \"\"Open Mike\"\". Her first show, on rape, makes Danny uncomfortable. Gary recognizes Amanda's voice as a call-in-viewer who was recently raped. Danny gives Val an engagement ring, and she tells Karen she loves Danny more than she ever loved anyone, even Gary.",

She does, but because she went to Danny's of her own free will and took a shower, there's no evidence. Danny calls Val and says Amanda is accusing him of outlandish things, but his lawyer said this is common in a divorce. Amanda and Gary try to convince Val that Danny is a rapist, but she thinks Amanda is being vengeful, and won't believe it. Gary calls Danny and says Amanda is making up horrible things about him, and they should get her psychiatric help. Danny agrees, so Gary invites him to the ranch. Gary locks Danny in the stable and goes after him with a baseball bat. Danny is cowering and whimpering in a fetal position, and then Gary unlocks the door and asks Danny if he enjoyed it.",

Oakman sends Joe to Canada to kill Mac, since Tom won't. Pomerantz tells Mac that he'll trade his books of illegal loans for his freedom. They go to the airport and exchange books. Joe is about to shoot Mac when the police arrest Joe and thank Tom for the tip. Tom calls Oakman and says Joe screwed up. He says Mac has the books and is going to the DA.

Harold calls Tom and says he knows who he works for, but will keep it a secret if he helps him out financially. Greg gets drunk, and the ghosts of Mary Francis and Galveston follow him around.

Carlos gives Greg floppy discs that Mary Francis had in Greg's computer. Police discover where the sniper shot from and due to garbage on the site, think he was there a long time, so Greg wasn't his target, Mary Francis was.",

Mac find out the Oakman chemicals are used in agriculture, but banned in the US because they cause liver cancer. When the chemicals were banned, Oakman used the pension funds to start a new company in Africa. Oakman is found dead. Eric visits and he and Michael make up. Linda is hired at Sumner Group. Karen and her \"\"Open Mike\"\" producer Dianne don't get along. Paige and Paula keep vigil over Greg, who is paralyzed and needs an operation. Police guard Greg's hospital room. Mary Francis's boyfriend Robert goes to the hospital and climbs in Greg's window. Robert tells Greg he is going to inject him with the chemicals Greg made, so he will suffer like his victims. Robert says Mary Francis was dying of this, so he killed her to publicize the plight, and then killed Oakman. Robert injects the chemicals into Greg, then gives himself up to the police.",

Gary finds him in a tree, and he explains to the twins that he is their father. Frank stays at the law office. Mac and Karen try to get the Williams' back together. Frank decides to come home, so they both go out to buy spumoni, as they always eat spumoni when making up after a fight. A bartender cuts Danny off, as he's very drunk. Danny buys liquor and drinks it while driving home. He and Pat pull into the cul-de-sac at the same time. Tragically, when she gets out of her car, Danny hits her.",

Linda tells Michael that Eric hit and abused her. He feels bad for her, and they go out. Wayne is arrested for stalking Karen, but he denies it. While he's in jail, someone puts a cow's heart in a box with a note that says \"\"you have a black heart\"\". The doctor tells Frank that Pat is brain dead, and it's time to pull the plug. Danny finds out and goes to Frank's, saying if he pulls the plug, then Frank has killed Pat, not him. Julie didn't know about this and screams she's going to get a lawyer. Frank punches Danny, and Mac comes over to break it up. Frank has a talk with Julie. The next day, Danny comes home and Julie points Danny's rifle at him, saying that he is going to die before Pat does.",

Tom comes back and confronts Greg with a gun to have his charges dropped, and tells Paige that Greg set him up. Paige is still mad. She goes to meet Greg for the cruise and asks if he's really dying, because she won't believe her good fortune until he is dead and buried. Kate gets a scholarship she was hoping for, but Claudia lies and says she didn't get it. Danny lets out all the horses at Gary's ranch.

He says Wayne was killed in his apartment, and he sent her all the letters. Dianne is there and calls the police. Jeff lies to the police, but Dianne taped the whole thing. Gary calls a frantic Val, and says the airbag saved him, but he kept passing out from the booze. He later talks to Karen, and Karen gives her famous \"\"Pollyanna\"\" speech. Paige makes up with Tom and moves in with him. Anne receives compromising photos of herself and a note demanding a million dollars. Danny is found dead and police say his fingers were broken, so they'll have to investigate. The coroner tells Val she's responsible for Danny's body and she's being charged rent until she has his body moved.",

Nick apologizes to Anne for suspecting her and is worried about what Marcos will do to him for losing the money. Val fell on her head, but insists she is okay.

Claudia refuses to tell Steve or Kate who Steve's father is. Anne and Nick try to find out if the doll is worth something or if something's hidden in it. The dog rips the doll apart. Val comes by and yells at Anne to stay away from Gary. Seeing the dog, she takes it. Then a man breaks in and demands a vial that was hidden in the doll. Paige comes in with security to kick Anne and Nick out, and the man is arrested. Anne and Nick determine that the dog ate the vial, so they break into Gary's barn, but all the puppies look alike.",

Two different parties want it, so they make a copy and sell it to both, for a total of $550,000. They rent Tom's apartment. Charlotte tells Frank she doesn't want a serious relationship with him, so he goes on a series of disastrous dates. Claudia makes up a story about who Steve's father is, but he doesn't buy it. Linda jumps the gun on a project of Paige's, and Greg reams her out but she decides to still sleep with him. Mac finds out he will be disbarred for hiding Jason. Jason moves into the MacKenzies, and tries to be really perfect and helpful. Mac tells him to just relax and he himself.",

Mrs. Richfield wants Linda to work on her account with Paige. Paige places a sexy ad on a phone date line and gives Linda's phone number. Steve tells Kate his parents were forced out of their logging business by a big logging company, and his father was killed, and his mother died 6 months later. He said he got drunk and beat up the company representative, and that's why he was in jail. Steve finds out Greg owns the logging company. Jason's paper on an American Hero has won a regional contest, and the final prize is a year abroad in Sweden. Jason doesn't want to read the paper, because it's about his father. At the ceremony Jason changes his essay to be about Mac. Michele Lee sings as several clips of Steve Shaw are shown.",

Steve decides to go back to his logging town, and Kate decides to help him move. Claudia goes to Steve's and hides her gun in his van. Claudia calls the police saying Steve is agitated and stole her gun. The police stop Steve's van and find the gun. Steve tells Kate that having the gun violates his parole. Steve pushes a policeman, and another officer shoots and kills him. Linda can't find her tape, but finds the one of Paige, and puts it in his car. The police question Paige as she was the last one to be seen with him. The officer calls his partner - and it's Tom Ryan! Frank decides to go back to work for Mac. The gang wants Jason to join them, but Mac and Frank beat them up and they're arrested. Karen is shot with a paint pellet by a group of teens, and chases them in her car. The teen's car is hit by a truck. The kids are all unconscious and bloody. Jas",

His car is found at the beach, and Paige is really worried about him. Pierce comes home and tells Paige about the boat accident, and not being able to save his girlfriend. He says Victoria put him back together, but wouldn't let go when he didn't need her anymore, and that he had no reason to live until he met Paige.",

After the party Alex tells Claudia that he was there when Ruth tried to reach for her medication, but the bottle broke, and instead of helping her, Claudia just stood there and let her die. He says he has the cancelled checks that Claudia sent Rosa every month to keep her quiet. Gary is really hurting as the ranch is auctioned off. The Ewings move back to the cul-de-sac.",

She calls to alert Karen, but they can't find Meg. Greg meanwhile, has threatened Mary to stay away from Meg and leave town. Greg decides to quit, and gives 13% of his company to Claudia, 13% to Paige, and 13% to Meg, with Mac and Karen as her trustees. Alex sleeps with Kate and tells Claudia and Vanessa he genuinely has feelings for Kate. Claudia fires him, but Paige rehires him, so Claudia threatens to tell Kate about his affair with her and Vanessa. Greg sleeps with Paige, but then pulls away, and says he'll be around. He decides to get away for awhile. Anne wants to get back together with him, and tries to find him when she discovers she's pregnant. Gary decides to build low-rent housing in Michigan. He's mad at Val and tells Karen if she doesn't return in time, he'll leave without her. Claudia puts out a memo to limit Paige's power. Fur",
