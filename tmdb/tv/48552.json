The Special Police Operations Battalion (BOPE) has been charged with pacifying the slums (favelas), but BOPE's military occupation of increasing numbers of favelas has been criticized as heavy-handed. Some corrupt members of the BOPE, together with ex-police, have formed militia gangs of their own and are controlling many favelas by sinister means, openly extorting, torturing, killing and making criminals disappear. Still, there are hundreds of favelas, untouched by pacification, that remain under the control of drug gangs who act with complete impunity.

Inept law enforcement, the social stigma associated with rape, and a patriarchal social structure have allowed sexual assaults to plague Indian women. Delhi’s police department has vowed to hire more female officers and set up a help desk, but these measures are hardly a solution. Rapes in Delhi doubled in 2013, and as bad as it is in Delhi, the Indian countryside is even worse. Instead of investigating rape cases, rural police officers often ignore victims and their families. But one woman, Sampat Pal, has galvanized a group of rural women into the Gulabi Gang, or Pink Gang, to combat the injustice of sexual assault. Gelareh Kiazand heads to rural Indian to investigate the issue and embed with this revolutionary gang. “Genetic Passport” - From 1949 to 1989, the Soviet Union, determined to prepare for nuclear warfare, detonated more than 450 nuclear bombs in an area of Kazakhstan known as the Semipalatinsk Test Site. For hundreds of thousands of Kazakhs, radiation not only surrounded them, but became part of their DNA. In an effort to curtail the birth of a new generation of deformed children, a Kazakh doctor recently tried to implement a mandatory “genetic passport” allowing people to know if their genes were damaged by radiation. Thomas Morton goes to Kazakhstan to learn more about this controversial initiative.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":2,"show_id":48552,"still_path":"/4LPtX5eJjIuATbf04ADvlKTr51x.jpg","vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-05-09","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"standard","id":989931,"name":"The Resource Curse & Deliver Us from Drought","overview":"As humanity’s appetite for energy grows exponentially, the extraction industry scrambles to the most remote regions on Earth to satisfy demand.

Though Iran, Afghanistan's neighbor, is an ultraconservative country, Afghan heroin flowing across the border has actually caused Iran to have the worst heroin use problem in the world. Suroosh Alvi gets a rare look inside Iran to meet the suffering heroin addicts, and see how the country is coping with the illegal drug trade. \"The Coldest War\" (correspondent: David Choe) - With the polar ice caps shrinking due to global warming, new trade routes are being exposed, along with billions of dollars' worth of natural-resource reserves. This is prime real estate and the five nations bordering the Arctic are readying themselves to fight for it. David Choe heads north to witness NATO forces participating in the largest polar military exercise in history. The problem is that there's one non-NATO country that already considers itself rightful owner of the region: Russia. With Vladimir Putin's recent military annexation of Crimea, there's a definite possibility its aggressions will boil over, returning the international community to precarious Cold War footing.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":2,"show_id":48552,"still_path":"/e6Z1aHHaRg9QCPqrphXU5lmaJY1.jpg","vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-06-13","episode_number":12,"episode_type":"finale","id":989940,"name":"Surveillance City & The Forgotten War","overview":"\"Surveillance City\" (correspondent: Vikram Gandhi) - Camden, New Jersey is one of the poorest and drug-ridden cities in the country, and its murder rate is 12 times the national average. In 2011, the city cut its police force almost in half, with nearly 80,000 residents regularly being policed by 12 cops at a time. The state stepped in to overhaul the department, introducing an experimental \"Metro\" security apparatus equipped with futuristic technologies like gunshot detecting, triangulation microphones, and automatic license-plate readers. As similar surveillance systems are implemented across the country, Vikram Gandhi goes to Camden to see how these tactics are working, how residents feel about their loss of privacy, and what the future of policing might be. \"The Forgotten War\" (correspondent: Ben Anderson) - A decade ago, the crisis in Darfur was a cause celebre. American politicians, activists, and celebrities took to the media to condemn Sudanese President Omar al-Bashir for his brutal genocide, and to send out a call for justice and aid his victims. Yet today, world attention has waned, despite the fact that President Bashir remains in power. People continue to die, and millions of refugees remain in overburdened camps filled with malnourished children. Without sufficient aid from the international community, Sudanese rebel groups are stepping in to fight for justice on their own terms. Ben Anderson goes to the refugee camps in Chad and Sudan to meet the victims the world has forgotten, and the rebels poised for civil war.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":2,"show_id":48552,"still_path":"/hVu0SLqW9qBdKj4xDrfi91hfcLW.jpg","vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 2","overview":"","id":61228,"poster_path":"/f1fhdee2g37IRO0YIzDkzquHsxf.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":8.7},"3":{"_id":"54e2415c9251411953007e21","air_date":"2015-03-06","episodes":[{"air_date":"2015-03-06","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1042371,"name":"Our Rising Oceans","overview":"A report on climate change that features a visit to Antarctica to observe melting glaciers and a report on rising sea levels in Bangladesh.
