Through the rise of the bond market in Renaissance Italy. With the advent of bonds, war finance was transformed and spread to north-west Europe and across the Atlantic.

After all, what better foundation for a property-owning democracy than a campaign of privatisation encompassing housing? An economic theory says that markets can't function without mortgages, because it's only by borrowing against their assets that entrepreneurs can get their businesses off the ground. But what if mortgages are bundled together and sold off to the highest bidder?","production_code":"","runtime":49,"season_number":1,"show_id":28209,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2008-12-22","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"finale","id":2257828,"name":"Chimerica","overview":"Since the 1990s, once risky markets in Asia, Latin America and eastern Europe have become better investments than the UK or US stock market.
