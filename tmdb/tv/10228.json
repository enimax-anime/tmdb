The series stars Mary Tyler Moore in her return to series television after an absence of over six years, during which time she appeared on Broadway in Whose Life Is It Anyway? and in the dramatic film Ordinary People. After The Mary Tyler Moore Show, her subsequent ventures into series television, the variety show Mary and The Mary Tyler Moore Hour had been short-running ratings disasters, and Moore decided to return to the sitcom format which had brought her the greatest television success.","popularity":3.342,"poster_path":"/7OJYrv7h2psuEO7vrGxLsgpdoJt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":56460,"logo_path":null,"name":"Shukovsky English Entertainment","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1985-12-11","episode_count":13,"id":20244,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5257fe7f19c29531db3361e3","air_date":"1985-12-11","episodes":[{"air_date":"1985-12-11","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":421347,"name":"From Pillar to Post","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":10228,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257fe7f19c29531db3361fd","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213771,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Isaacs","original_name":"David Isaacs","popularity":1.561,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257fe7f19c29531db33620b","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":167482,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Levine","original_name":"Ken Levine","popularity":2.439,"profile_path":"/uYUP3GmVJvSndqNGfunanZPHfhl.jpg"},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257fe7f19c29531db33621b","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Danny DeVito","original_name":"Danny DeVito","popularity":23.66,"profile_path":"/uLW4Y9yjtwxtVmcJfwHZ7sKJai4.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1985-12-18","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":421349,"name":"Make My Day","overview":"Jo decides that Mary isn't tough enough in dealing with a shady businessman, so she tells him off - while pretending to be Mary.
