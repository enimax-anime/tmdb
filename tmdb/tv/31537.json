As the work continues to pile up, Tia must find trustworthy help and her irreplaceable parolee, Earl, who is about to get off parole, may have found one solution to her problem. Tia's daughters and adopted twin sons continue to be committed to Villalobos. And a hard-working employee makes the transition from inmate on work release to parolee, while Tania's \"honeymoon\" with her new husband, Perry, has been spent helping her mom keep her head above water.",

The rescues this season continue to make a lasting impact on the team, from an abandoned dog with a severe skin condition to strays that lead the Villalobos employees on a wild goose chase. And this season, the Villalobos team sees families from Idaho to Florida to Wisconsin, who've opened their hearts and homes for a new family member. Later in the season, Tia partners with Amanda Giese from Amanda to the Rescue.",
