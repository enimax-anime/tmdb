The World War II series based on Väinö Linna's classic novel closely follows a machine gun company of the Finnish Army on the Karelian front during the Continuation War between Finland and the Soviet Union, from mobilization in 1941 to the Moscow Armistice in 1944. It's a story about how camaraderie, humor, and a desire to survive connect men on their journey. War upends the lives of both the individual soldiers and those left on the home front, and leaves its mark on the entire nation.","popularity":4.013,"poster_path":"/otFtdZ0KS32XvVe5eZu1Y1OglRl.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":77737,"logo_path":null,"name":"Elokuvaosakeyhtiö Suomi 2017","origin_country":"FI"},{"id":96653,"logo_path":null,"name":"Kvikmyndafélag Íslands","origin_country":"IS"},{"id":11199,"logo_path":"/ursSXLOZaDxiZ84sEgfXbiFnYaa.png","name":"SCOPE Pictures","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FI","name":"Finland"},{"iso_3166_1":"IS","name":"Iceland"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2018-12-30","episode_count":5,"id":113850,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/gxWdhYnaHsKaFextP1JoweMGKRy.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Finnish","iso_639_1":"fi","name":"suomi"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":14,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5c07e18d0e0a262cfb0fe227","air_date":"2018-12-30","episodes":[{"air_date":"2018-12-30","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1635595,"name":"Part 1: It's Going To Be A Beautiful Day","overview":"A Finnish Army machine gun company heads east, many of its soldiers seeing battle for the first time.","production_code":"","runtime":55,"season_number":1,"show_id":84706,"still_path":"/rohHceQyJ0Zu57b3dGQYF6KUyBO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5c07e79092514113290feb0c","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87322,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Aku Louhimies","original_name":"Aku Louhimies","popularity":2.743,"profile_path":"/5B7gYl40cURlqc4EkG0wgf1eplm.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-12-30","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1635597,"name":"Part 2: Petrozavodsk, Petrozavodsk","overview":"The Finnish invasion continues, but with heavy losses.
