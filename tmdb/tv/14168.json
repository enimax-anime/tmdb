Malik knows first hand what Yelena Moyan, the boys’ mother, is going through. Yelena cannot understand who would do this. Her boys had no enemies.\n\nWhen another body is discovered in waters near by, it seems the boys were murdered because they witnessed the execution of a criminal.\n\nMalik is determined to track down the armed gang who he feels are responsible for this latest round of murders. He knows he must find the identity of the head of the gang, but the closer he gets to the truth, the more bodies appear.\n\nMalik is starting to question Travis’ loyalty and his friendship with dead gang member, Sterling. Travis says they were just army buddies back in Iraq. But Travis kept silent about this, so what else has he kept back from Major Crime? If he’s not corrupt, what is holding him back from sharing his knowledge? What is the secret Travis wants to remain buried?\n\nAs Malik enters the battle zone against the armed gang, he still has doubt. Which side is Travis on?\n\nMalik knows that in the war against crime, there are no heroes, no glory, just a job to be done. And, like a soldier, he has to put his life on the line to do it.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"2011-06-01","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":3,"show_id":14168,"still_path":null},"name":"East West 101","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":223,"logo_path":"/aQ7chdTN42fz0qtmih3yYnDWp4F.png","name":"SBS","origin_country":"AU"}],"number_of_episodes":20,"number_of_seasons":3,"origin_country":["AU"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"East West 101","overview":"Zane Malik and the Major Crime Squad investigate crime and murder in all quarters of multicultural Sydney.","popularity":9.732,"poster_path":"/hSOTJd61TMzc7Z6jGHd9QHhVjIt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":82381,"logo_path":null,"name":"Knapman Wyld Television","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2007-12-06","episode_count":6,"id":25486,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/hS806VhSgikPIRnXixTatrKun1R.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":8.3},{"air_date":"2009-10-13","episode_count":7,"id":25487,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2011-04-20","episode_count":7,"id":25488,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52582ed4760ee36aaa8c3661","air_date":"2007-12-06","episodes":[{"air_date":"2007-12-06","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":515431,"name":"The Enemy Within","overview":"Muslim detective, Zane Malik, is fighting crime in a post 9/11 world.
