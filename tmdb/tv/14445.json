It ran on ITV for two series in 2008–2009. The subject of the first series was the production of a soap called Echo Beach, each episode of which aired directly after the Moving Wallpaper episode about its production. The second series was based around the production of a \"zombie show\" called Renaissance. Ben Miller confirmed in May 2009 on his Twitter account that no further series will be made.\n\nThe title, \"Moving Wallpaper\", is a disparaging term applied to uninspiring TV shows, or to television in general, referring to the perception that modern television viewers are \"mindless absorbers of images\", as if staring at wallpaper.","popularity":3.467,"poster_path":"/r9Htt5f2ZkvXh00Kltn1FBWEAVm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2008-01-10","episode_count":12,"id":25851,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2009-02-27","episode_count":6,"id":25852,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258311b760ee36aaa8ea240","air_date":"2008-01-10","episodes":[{"air_date":"2008-01-10","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":519625,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"ITV's new soap Echo Beach is just days away from launching and a new producer called Jonathan Pope is hired.
