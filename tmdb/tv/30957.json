Chris has extreme difficulty with the task and hands the photo of the mask to the incorrect person twice, each time being forced to go to the back of the line.

Most teams are able to get flights, but David and Jeff and Steve and Dave have to head to another airport and lose critical time when they are caught in a bad traffic jam. In Amsterdam, teams must go boating to a museum and this leads to massive confusion, particularly for the team of Tian and Jaree. In the Detour, teams must choose between 500 Kg or 15 Feet. In 500 Kg, they drive 30 miles and then weight out 500 Kg of cheese and in 15 ft., they have to drive only 12 miles and search through cow manure for their clue. Most teams go for the cow manure, but a couple of them opt for the cheese. Afterwards, they face a Roadblock in which they must gather 25 live eels. In the end, despite serious fighting between Tian and Jaree, they manage to squeak past Steve and Dave, who, after narrowly escaping elimination in past weeks, are eliminated from the race.",

The jockeying and bickering immediately begin at the bus station, but some patient planning pays off for a few teams who take a later bus that makes less stops and then visit a travel agent. Some unfortunate airport luck leaves Bob and Joyce catching a later flight and striving to remain in the race. In St. Petersburg, Russia, the teams get a Detour clue to choose either a hockey challenge: Block Five Shots, or a drinking challenge: drink one shot. The choices are about evenly split and no team has a particularly tough time at the Detour. What many do have a very tough time with is the Roadblock, which involves eating two pounds of caviar.

Once there, they travel to a ski jump where they find themselves facing a Roadblock. In this Roadblock one team member must perform an \"\"Olympian\"\" feat --- sliding down a long zip-line. They then visit a Viking Village where they stay the night. In the morning, the teams split up into two groups of their choice and then compete to paddle boats across the lake. One team makes a critical mistake. At the Detour, the teams must choose between Endurance or Accuracy. Endurance in involves rollerblading one and three quarter miles, while Accuracy involves participating in three grueling challenges. Many teams initially choose Endurance and then opt to do Accuracy instead. Later, the critical mistake comes back to bite the team that made it --- but the thirty minute time penalty might not be enough to cause their elimination.",

Both tasks seem rather difficult, one called Count requires successfully counting 2,304 objects, while the other called Build requires successful, proper building of a desk. Some initially choose the counting and ditch it for the Desk option. Many who choose the counting fall dangerously behind. A Roadblock involves rolling rough bales of hay to find hidden clues. There are 270 bales of hay and only 20 clues. This proves very exhausting for many teams and the possible downfall of one.

One team-member, feeling that there's no way he can complete this, decides to take a four-hour penalty, and then convinces others to do it as well.

Once in Brazil, the teams find a clue directing them to take a taxi three miles to the Viaduto Santa Efigenia bridge. There, they find a Detour choice of either Rotor Head or Motor Head.

A couple that choose this option later opt for Rotor Head instead. The teams then participate in a Brazilian religious ceremony culminating in a candle-lighting.

A scramble for flights eventually ends with all teams making it on the same flight to Anchorage. Once in Anchorage, the teams travel 30 miles to Mirror Lake. There, a Detour involves a choice of Drill It or Deliver It. As Deliver It is snowed out, all teams choose Drill It, which requires them to drill ten holes in a lake and then use a shack to cover at least two of them. After completing this task, the teams head to Kincaid Park, don snowshoes and hunt for a clue. This clue directs them to fly to their final destination city --- Denver, Colorado --- the same town in which they started. Ultimately, the teams find themselves back at the Red Rocks Ampitheater.

A scramble for flights immediately begins and teams find that flight placement in this leg plays a major role in where they will ultimately end up. One team makes a risky move in opting to take standby-only seats on a flight, which ultimately gains them valuable time and allows them to arrive in first. One team is disappointed when they believe they have secured seats on a flight, but are removed, told that they had been given the seats in error. Once in Mozambique, teams takes one of four dhows (ferries) into Zanzibar, where they then take part in a Roadblock that requires them to choose between either a task that \"taxes the mind\" or one that \"taxes the muscles.\" They then traveled 15 miles by taxi to the \"bush country\" of Kikungwi for a Roadblock that involved skill and accuracy. In a leg that involved a great disparity between first and last, a close finish led to the elimination of another team.",

The race contained ten game pieces, each representing a leg of the race and behind each was a symbol representing either Route Info, Roadblock, Detour or Pit Stop. Teams had to search through 150 clue boxes for pictures to place in the appropriate spots on the game-board. Each time they placed a correct picture, a green light would appeared and they were able to move on to the next one.
