Sometime later, his co-workers show him a newspaper showing their deaths when their van crashed because of the failed brakes, but he coldly dismisses it. That night, after Sonny is the last salesman left, as he closes up, three cars turn on and surround them. He thinks his co-workers are playing a joke on him. Then a fourth vehicle arrives, the same van he sold the society kings, and it runs Sonny over, killing him\n\n\"Surveillance Camera\" - Alec, an immigrant, takes over a convenience store and is saving up to bring his family to the U.S. Later that day, a robber holds him up and seems to know about Alec's savings in a cashbox.

The next morning, Zorelda work up and discovered the two men not there, but a note that said \"Here is $900.00 in nine $100.00 bills\", so when the banker came to her house, she gave him the $900.00 bills. When the banker left her house, two men robbed him and took off their masks, and they ended up being the two wet men that ended at at Zorelda's house the night before and revealed themselves as Frank and Jesse James.","production_code":"","runtime":43,"season_number":4,"show_id":12323,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52581f17760ee36aaa78a06f","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1228827,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Anker","original_name":"Steve Anker","popularity":1.176,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Matt Richmond (segment \"The Devil's Autograph\")","credit_id":"63e660c5d29bdd00845f99c7","order":1159,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1498152,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dion Luther","original_name":"Dion Luther","popularity":2.295,"profile_path":"/mW24YEuW9YXvapnmLnCxgmXwmaz.jpg"},{"character":"Lloyd Corbiel (segment \"The Devil's Autograph\")","credit_id":"63e660dca3d027008383b2e8","order":1160,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Byron Lucas","original_name":"Byron Lucas","popularity":1.342,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Judge (segment \"The Devil's Autograph\")","credit_id":"63e660f29512e10079661ae3","order":1161,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11831,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mary Black","original_name":"Mary Black","popularity":4.046,"profile_path":"/enDcsji4K79inZU3LBC2dO1peKo.jpg"},{"character":"Jury Forewoman (segment \"The Devil's Autograph\")","credit_id":"63e661392fccee0081718795","order":1162,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3914312,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Ryan","original_name":"Jennifer Ryan","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Charlie Lunt (segment \"Mail Order Degree\")","credit_id":"63e661b6f48b3400a08951e5","order":1163,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83959,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Mondy","original_name":"Bill Mondy","popularity":3.813,"profile_path":"/whkOSQgB1RkxGpYo4IO6WKhXL98.jpg"},{"character":"Jeannie (segment \"Mail Order Degree\")","credit_id":"63e661eff48b3400d5789ff5","order":1164,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3914321,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michelle Harrison","original_name":"Michelle Harrison","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Student (segment \"Mail Order Degree\")","credit_id":"63e6620ff48b34008428f8cc","order":1165,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3914322,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Omar Forrest","original_name":"Omar Forrest","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Vinny Rose (segment \"The News Stand\")","credit_id":"63e662d9c2ff3d00c3db7484","order":1166,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Chatwin","original_name":"Justin Chatwin","popularity":15.957,"profile_path":"/qByFlG1GqX2PTM7J8r14wSQwbZ.jpg"},{"character":"Doc (segment \"The News Stand\")","credit_id":"63e662ef9512e10079661ba5","order":1167,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":998002,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Keith Martin Gordey","original_name":"Keith Martin Gordey","popularity":4.389,"profile_path":"/96z8LgfRL1nNFSfA4VT9y25tXfC.jpg"},{"character":"Mugger (segment \"The News Stand\")","credit_id":"63e66307d29bdd00b2f973fb","order":1168,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1608629,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Preston Cook","original_name":"Preston Cook","popularity":2.666,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Addison Montgomery (segment \"The News Stand\")","credit_id":"63e66336a3d02700c82c13af","order":1169,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3235378,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bo Fred Olsson","original_name":"Bo Fred Olsson","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Michelle Lambert (segment \"The Murder of Roy Hennessey\")","credit_id":"63e664a5d29bdd008c9da5f9","order":1170,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":52394,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Lee Smith","original_name":"Lauren Lee Smith","popularity":10.985,"profile_path":"/9rpryFGqrUUafGRMhnd6fQAlzHc.jpg"},{"character":"Stacy Gilmore (segment \"The Murder of Roy Hennessey\")","credit_id":"63e664cb2fccee00bc274716","order":1171,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25414,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jody Thompson","original_name":"Jody Thompson","popularity":2.293,"profile_path":"/3bhRTl6RQUco8a2cOF3a7uBvIj.jpg"},{"character":"Detective Tanner (segment \"The Murder of Roy Hennessey\")","credit_id":"63e664e89512e10079661c9a","order":1172,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":963962,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Keating","original_name":"Fred Keating","popularity":1.097,"profile_path":"/j3XjPgQoLY45QDSjYlPB6Vk25Wb.jpg"},{"character":"Jerry Fletcher (segment \"The Murder of Roy Hennessey\")","credit_id":"63e6652b9512e100b2b1aab6","order":1173,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":158554,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher R.

While eating at a restaurant in the country, she sees a man that she can't stop looking at. The man approaches her and asks demandingly why she is staring at him, and she just said that he was familiar looking and she was sorry. When she went back to her hotel to pack her bags and leave the town, he came up behind her and handcuffed her and threw her on the bed, and he asked her why she was staring at him. She was upset and said she was sorry. He pulled up a chair next to the bed and said that he would sit there all night until he got the real answer out of her. After a little bit of time passed, and he fell asleep in the chair after drinking liquor, so she opened the door and ran to the owner of the hotel. He called the police, and they came and arrested the man. The policeman told the lady that he was wanted for the murder of a women, only to found out that he murdered the person she got her eyes from, and the eyes witnessed the murder and couldn't stop watching him.\n\n\"The Fine Line\" - Two female twins seemingly have an amazing ability to share each others' feelings, such as one sister getting poked by a knitting needle, while the other also feels the pain. One night, one of them drives out alone and is involved in an off-road car accident. The sister at home feels strange and senses trouble. A male friend who is with her at the moment witnesses radio music somehow coming from the TV set, which is broadcasting a basketball game. The mysterious radio signals, alongside the twins' phenomenal ability leads the sister and her friend to investigate. After pinpointing the exact location of the accident with ease, the other sister is sent to the hospital and saved.\n\n\"The Wrong Turn\" - A man had been living in his hometown for ten years, but couldn't remember where to make his delivery. He was shocked because he couldn't find anything correctly. He saw an old lady in the road waving her arms, so he swiveled out of the way before he hit her and he drove up near a building with his truck and mattress. He suddenly heard a thump on the car and crying. He saw a little boy on the mattress in the back of his truck who looked to be alright. The boy said he fell from the building. Suddenly, a man cleaning up near the street said he knew that the boy lived upstairs, so he and the truck driver went in their room and saw an old lady lying on the floor. When they turned her over, the truck driver was shocked to realize this was the lady that was waving her arms frantically in the street. They revived her, and she said that she had passed out because she forgot to take her medicine.
