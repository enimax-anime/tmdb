Shortly thereafter, a bomb detonates in front of the editorial offices; only two days later the daily reappears with the headline: ‘The Mafia may threaten us, our investigation continues.’ Inspired by true events, L’ORA takes place in Palermo of the late 50 ́s and early 1960s. Newly minted Editor-in-Chief with his group of fearless journalists focus their investigation on organized crime and its reach into every corner of church and society.",
