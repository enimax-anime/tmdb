When an item in the first basket prompts the chefs to make very similar appetizer plates, the cooks scramble to distinguish themselves. In the entrée round, the judges are happy when the chefs take the opportunity to showcase their unique styles, but they must still send someone's salmon plate to the chopping block. In the end, the final two competitors find noodles and a cool candy in the dessert basket.",
