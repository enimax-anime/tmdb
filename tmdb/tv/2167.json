He reaches a point where he wants the memories to stop. He is tortured by the thought that his wife died while he was blaming her for the death of their son.\n\nUnable to change patients, Bron is forced to help Phil come to terms with his memories.

Now, for the first time in their lives, they are going to be separated by something they never anticipated: good health.

Thomas clings to Bron as a familiar face and is comforted when she is back the following day as an agency nurse. He bonds with her but she just cannot manage to explain to him that his nanna is not coming back.

At first Von is helping with the 'interviews' but it soon becomes clear to Hilary that Von could be the perfect candidate.

Steph is shocked when she hears Kerri say she has been assaulted by an ambulance officer. Unaware that the woman has embroidered her story and that the ambulance officer is Ben, Steph encourages Kerri to report the incident. This results in a huge rift between husband and wife, with Ben accusing Steph of not knowing him at all if she thinks him capable of such behaviour.\n\nSteph is left out on a limb when she discovers that Kerri has a history of ill-treatment of her children and was very likely to have been lying to cover her own actions.

Cathy is brought up to Ward 17 and is put under Mitch and Steph's care. She is a bright and talented girl and it looks like she will be able to be discharged quickly into the care of her loving parents. So the shocking and unpredictable actions he takes when no-one is looking causes Mitch to completely re-evaluate his treatment of her and land Steph in trouble.\n\nMitch has noted that Steph is \"away with the pixies\" all day — no one is aware that Ben has walked out on her.

The mood swing is connected to Ryan's heavy drinking. But Mitch is called back to the hospital and Terri has to deal with the end of the evening solo.\n\nHer father's anger is aimed at her moves for independence and he accuses her of betraying her calling. When he turns his anger on his wife, Terri fakes an illness to give her mother a reason for staying the night. The next morning, Terri spots bruises on her mother's arms and realises that Ryan's drunken bullying may extend to physical abuse. Mitch suspects the same thing but when he tries to raise the subject with Terri, she shuns it. It is not something she wants to admit or face.\n\nBen has left Steph and is back living with his parents. He has told Bron but no-one else knows. Ben and Steph are keeping their miserable secret, ashamed to admit their marriage has fallen apart.

She chooses to place her own interpretation on this relationship, especially when the first word the female utters is her husband's name.

Her enthusiasm swings to anger and she is prepared to let the truth come out. However, she is outvoted by the rest of the staff who attempt a coverup as the male victim's wife arrives.

The situation is further complicated when it is discovered that, while she looks fourteen, Mary is twenty-one and has a blood pressure level a middle-aged man would be worried about.

Terri becomes a part of Luke's strategy and together they manage to encourage the priest up to Ward 17 and from there to the operating theatre.\n\nLuke's unusual tactics win him brownie points on the ward and, boosted by his success, he invites Steph out to dinner. She accepts, herself on something of a high after recent academic success. But their date is doomed to failure because Steph still is not sure about her separation from Ben and also she is about to make a major professional mistake.\n\nTony Hurst, the ward clerk, is struggling to keep his head above water while he deals with equipment breakdowns and a busy schedule. Steph inadvertently leaves an exposed needle at the nurses' station whilst she is responding to an emergency, and Tony suffers a needlestick injury.\n\nIt is the beginning of a turn for the worse for everybody. The needle in question has been used on another difficult patient — a young woman, Simone, who is apparently suffering from kidney stones. It turns out she is just scamming Mitch in order to get free pethidine shots and she is actually a recidivist junkie.\n\nSteph goes out on her date with Luke, encouraged by him to try to cheer up. The date turns out badly. Steph would be even more miserable if she knew that Ben has heard about the date. Steph, unbeknownst to Ben, has realised, via the date, that her affection for him is far from dead. She tries to approach him and, without telling her that he knows about her seeing Luke, he rejects her in no uncertain terms.\n\nThe only person who seems to be getting any good news on this particular day is Von, who finally learns that her illness is not, as she suspected, cancer but lupus. Her euphoria is a source of concern for Mitch, who would like her to take things a whole lot more seriously.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":2,"show_id":2167,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1999-08-17","episode_number":29,"episode_type":"standard","id":152226,"name":"Just Like A Woman","overview":"Connor is stunned to find Alana, a female patient, is a pre-operative transgender. His resolve to cope is shattered when he subsequently learns that she used to be his football coach, and a mentor after Connor's father died. Repulsed and betrayed, Connor wants nothing more to do with Alana. Nor can he understand how Alana's son Tom, also an old friend, can be so accepting of the situation. Alana is diagnosed with breast cancer as a result of the hormone therapy she is on. She refuses to have a mastectomy and will not stop taking the hormones, as it would mean returning to the body she felt trapped in all her life. Connor confronts her for being a coward. Surely any life is better than none at all? Tom helps Connor appreciate the significance and bravery of Alana's transformation. Her distress over the injustice of her fate and insistence that she is still the person Connor admired, finally makes him accept not only the choice Alana has made, but Alana as a woman.\n\nWhile Steph worries about her husband, Ben enjoys the freedom of being a separated man by flirting with a woman he is called to attend.

Fearing whoever shot the judge will return to finish the job off, police arrange for him to be under strict police guard as he is taken off to All Saints. The police presence on the ward puts extra pressure on the nursing staff; it is not only the hassle of showing ID every time they enter the judge's room but the feeling that every person who walks on to the ward could be the one who shot him. The judge's son waits dutifully for him to return from theatre. On first impressions they appear to have a strong relationship. It is not long, however, before the cracks start to show. As police begin to suspect the culprit may be a lot closer to home than first thought, Nicholas reveals to Terri it was he who shot his father — having caught him in the arms of a woman other than his mother.

Soon after she begins to feel woozy. Thinking it is her weak attempt at getting sick leave so she can go overseas with Luke, Ben teases her. It is not until she collapses that Ben starts to take her seriously. With Ben's help, Mitch diagnoses her condition. It is a tense wait as the anti-venom kicks in and Bron begins to recover.

Mitch warns Simone against this, advising that the management of her hepatitis C must take priority over becoming pregnant.

The atmosphere is more relaxed than it is on a weekday — less staff, fewer interruptions, radios are playing, no one is in a hurry to do anything. Steph is running the ward, glad of the opportunity to be in charge without Terri looking over her shoulder. There is an air of everyone pitching in, covering for each other as there are no administrative minders; nurses do their own housekeeping, take phone calls, write bed tags and collect x-rays.\n\nEddie Furlong is brought in suffering from hypothermia, having been fished out of the river following a late night boating accident. Eddie obsessed by the whereabouts of his two crewmates, especially his young brother Marty, whom he learns has been declared brain dead following a serious head injury. Seemingly depressed by his brother's death, Eddie attempts suicide via a paracetamol overdose. But the true reasons behind his suicide attempt — guilt and remorse — are revealed when the other member of the party, Rob, who has just been discharged from St Angela's arrives on the ward to accuse Eddie of cowardice and murder. He claims Eddie was so obsessed with saving his own skin, he left his companions for dead. Despite prompt action from the Ward 17 staff, Eddie's overdose looks set to cause major liver damage and probably death. His only chance of leading a healthy life, or indeed surviving the overdose, is to have a liver transplant. And his brother's liver is the obvious candidate. But Eddie has misgivings about accepting an organ from the brother he neglected to save.\n\nBen and Mick's day begins innocuously when they revive a wealthy yuppie who has taken a narcotics overdose. The ungrateful patient gives a false name and refuses to accompany them to hospital, leaving a bad taste in Ben and Mick's mouths. Later, Ben and Mick spot the man's sports car in the doctors' car park at All Saints. Ben and Steph are certain the person who has OD'd is in fact Tom Snowdon — an up and coming anaesthetics registrar and mate of Luke's. Luke initially dismisses the allegations against his colleague, but a mixture of self-interest and ethics finally force him to confront Tom about the overdose. In doing so, Luke realises there is more to being a successful doctor than having a huge trust account and a privileged background — Tom's background.\n\nTerri is excited to be hosting brunch for her parents' 35th wedding anniversary. But things quickly sour when her intoxicated father slaps Eileen for some alleged past indiscretion. When Ryan attempts to do so again, Terri steps in to save her mother and causes her father to fall and break his hip. Caught between feelings of guilt over her actions and disgust over her father's, Terri arranges for her father to be admitted to Ward 17. Luke advises he will need a pin and plate inserted in his femur. Meanwhile, acting on a hunch, Mitch has secretively arranged a CT scan which reveals Ryan has life threatening cancer. Terri's abused mother rushes immediately to her husband's side, and Terri realises there is now no chance of her mother freeing herself from Ryan's controlling influence.\n\nMeanwhile, Jared has a challenging day dealing with an erratic drunk suffering from Korsakoff's syndrome.

But while Mitch performs a pleural tap to remove fluid from Dave's lung, Terri has to comfort Dave's wife Rosemary. When Rosemary goes home to rest for a while, Dave begs Terri and Mitch to allow him to have chemotherapy to extend his life a few weeks so he can see his daughters again at Christmas. Mitch has to break the news that chemotherapy now would not help.

Treating the boy's injuries is one thing, rekindling the joy of Christmas proves to be quite another.
