But how on earth do these objects work? To find out, James May (fuelled by endless cups of tea) heads into his workshop with thousands of little pieces to assemble some of our most beloved and recognisable objects from scratch to see what it actually takes to get them to work.","popularity":2.095,"poster_path":"/j5yTK1WbKNNMiD0TNVB0em3O9X8.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2016-04-04","episode_count":3,"id":83290,"name":"Series 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2016-12-28","episode_count":4,"id":83291,"name":"Series 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Czech","iso_639_1":"cs","name":"Český"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Documentary","vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":7,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"586903bd9251414e7500b846","air_date":"2016-04-04","episodes":[{"air_date":"2016-04-04","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1251264,"name":"Lawnmower","overview":"James is faced with the 331 pieces that make up a 1959 petrol lawnmower. The Suffolk Colt helped make mowing accessible to the masses by producing a smaller and affordable machine to keep our nation's lawns at regulation height. As this is a petrol lawnmower, James's first task is to put the engine back together before he gets to grips with the gearing, the clutch and the blades themselves. Armed only with his toolbox and an endless supply of tea, James experiences the highs and lows only possible when attempting to put history back together again, piece by piece.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":69340,"still_path":"/7agE0eLjGtr3dF2cV9GiUttvaHT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2016-04-05","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1251265,"name":"Telephone","overview":"James tackles a 1957 Bakelite dial telephone - 211 pieces, most of them very small indeed, must be reassembled in the correct order if this telephone is ever to ring again.
