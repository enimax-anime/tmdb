However, the job forces Avery to crash in his new role. Later in the season, Avery, determined to prove to Mike that the restoration business can profit, recruits a local legend to help him restore a 1942 Harley Davidson that he discovered buried in Mike’s junkyard. Fans will also see a personal side of the Rust Bros crew this season, with a visit to Avery’s family farm where Mike’s veterinary skills are tested and a Model T Ford is found; Avery recruiting his son for a restoration project; and Mike’s son Connor races in two demolition derbies – with smashing results.",

Former shop manager and best friend Avery Shoaf has opened his own shop: Wildman Restorations with help from his son Shafin. Will Avery continue to work with Mike or become another competitor? Mike still has over 400 cars in his ‘field of dreams’ and he continues to buy more cars than he restores. Business is brisk, but it’s crucial that Mike keeps his eye on the bottom line. If the money doesn’t flow, he could still sell off the entire operation – for the right offer…or does he have another trick up his sleeve?",

Later in the season, Avery, determined to prove to Mike that the restoration business can profit, recruits a local legend to help him restore a 1942 Harley Davidson that he discovered buried in Mike’s junkyard. Fans will also see a personal side of the Rust Bros crew this season, with a visit to Avery’s family farm where Mike’s veterinary skills are tested and a Model T Ford is found; Avery recruiting his son for a restoration project; and Mike’s son Connor races in two demolition derbies – with smashing results.",
