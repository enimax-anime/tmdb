    "overview": "Globe Trekker is an adventure tourism television series produced by Pilot Productions. The British series was inspired by the Lonely Planet travelbooks and began airing in 1994. Globe Trekker is broadcast in over 40 countries across six continents.\n\nEach episode features a host, called a traveller, who travels with a camera crew to a country—often, a relatively exotic locale—and experiences the sights, sounds, and culture that the location has to offer. Special episodes feature in-depth city, beach, dive, shopping, history, festival, and food guides.\n\nThe show often goes far beyond popular tourist destinations in order to give viewers a more authentic look at local culture. Presenters usually participate in different aspects of regional life, such as attending a traditional wedding or visiting a mining community. They address the viewer directly, acting as tourists-turned-tour guides, but are also filmed interacting with locals and discovering interesting locations in unrehearsed sequences. Globe Trekker also sometimes includes brief interviews with backpackers who share tips on independent travel in that particular country.",

It was a major place of worship sacred to the god Jupiter.\n\nIan begins his visit to Syria in Damascus, where he observes the 'jumping sufis' experiencing religious ecstasy in a mosque, and relaxes in a Turkish bath.\n\nIn Aleppo, Ian goes shopping in a large outside market called a Souk, then goes to see some clay beehive style houses nearby. He is introduced to the world of the 'whirling dervishes', one of Islam's important mystical orders, inspired in the 13th Century by the poet Mevlana Rumi.\n\nThe final leg of his journey takes Ian south east to the ancient Roman desert town Palmyra.

Few Western people venture here but as traveller Neil Gibson discovers it offers some of Asia's most mind-blowing landscapes, a kaleidoscope of cultures and a deeply generous people.\n\nHis journey begins in Karachi, a bustling port town. He comes across a film crew making a movie on the life of Jinnah, and takes the opportunity to find out more about the founder of Pakistan. Leprosy is still a massive problem amongst the poor in Karachi and Neil visits one of the hospitals that treats lepers. Neil then takes a horse and cart to the Saddar Bazaar, Karachi's main shopping area, and gets himself kitted out in a shalwar kamiz, Pakistan's native dress.\n\nFrom Karachi, it's a 17 hour train ride north to the sufi city of Multan, inhabited by the ancient Indus valley civilisation. The 4000 year old city is home to the mystical side of Islam and Neil arrives in time for the Urs festival, where every year the holy men come to chill out and trance out. Neil has his fortune told by a bird, has his turban stuffed with onions and rides a camel to the spectacular Derawar Fort in the midst of the Cholistan desert.\n\nNeil's next stop is Lahore, once the centre of the Mogul empire and considered to be Pakistan's cultural and artistic capital. Here Neil visits the last bastion of British colonialism, Aitchinson College where Imran Khan was once a pupil, and visits the incredible Badshahi mosque, one of the largest mosques in the world. Neil learns about the strict lifestyle required by the Koran and takes part in some Kushti wrestling.\n\nA bus journey 440 kilometres north-west takes Neil to the frontier town of Peshawar. Due to it's proximity to Afghanistan, the town is full of smuggled goods and as Neil discovers, it is possible to buy almost anything in the markets. Neil then visits the legendary Khyber Pass and looks out at the real-life 'Gateway to India'.\n\nNeil takes a short flight to the north-western extremity of Pakistan and the exotic valley of Chitral. This is where the game of Polo originated and Neil is invited to take part in a game. He stays with the Kalash people, believed to have descended from Alexander the Great.\n\nFrom here Neil journeys north to Gilgit for the incredible Ashura festival, a Shiite festival which commemorates the death of Iman Hussein, grandson of the prophet Mohammed who was murdered in the desert. During this festival, the Shiites whip themselves with knives to show their grief, until they are completely exhausted.\n\nFrom Gilgit Neil heads up to the Hunza valley to the start point of a three day trek, crossing two incredible glaciers and ending his journey looking out at the stunning views from Rush Peak.",

Ian Wright begins his journey in Darwin, where many travellers meet before trekking through the Outback.\n\nFrom Darwin Ian passes through Kakadu National Park where he feeds the crocodiles and encounters a black headed python. From there he journeys to Katherine in time for the Barunga Aboriginal Festival of sports and culture.\n\nCloncurry used to be the biggest copper producer in the British Empire, but these days the town is rather quieter. Ian is invited to participate in a Kangaroo hunt, which he does somewhat reluctantly. He also tries his hand at Bush Poetry with a little help from the locals.\n\nThe next leg of Ian's journey takes him to Alice Springs where he looks at some Aboriginal Art and experiences working life on a cattle station covering a modest 300,000 acres of land. After all that hard work, Ian finds the most luxurious way to travel, floating in a hot air balloon over Alice Springs.\n\nAbout three hundred miles South West of Alice is Australia's most famous natural landmark - Ayers Rock. It's now known as Uluru, and Ian meets some of the few Aborigine people who still live around here. The area was home to the Anangu aborigines for thousands of years but now that it has become a major tourist attraction only a few communities remain.\n\nIan heads north west along the 600 mile Tanami track which links Alice Springs and Hall Creek in Western Australia. Whilst travelling through the desert Ian eats a bush grub dug up on the roadside and also dines on kangaroo tail. Another four hundred miles west of Halls Creek, Ian visits the coastal town of Broome. At night he sees light reflecting on the mud flats, known locally as the staircase to the moon. He also visits an area around Cape Leveque, home to aborigines known as the Bardi people, where he is shown how to catch crabs.\n\nThe final leg of his journey takes Ian to the town of Kununurra where he gets work as a bar man at a Bachelors and Spinsters Ball - a raucous event. He ends his journey in the Bungle Bungles, spectacular ancient hills in the Kimberley Ranges which few tourists visit.",

The event lasts for six days and whilst there, Justine attends an Indian Rodeo, checks out Native American cuisine and watches some amazing tribal dances.\n\nFrom Gallup, Justine takes a spectacular train journey north east to Santa Fe, where she acquires a motorbike and cruises along to Taos. She stops in Taos to investigate the Earthships - homes constructed entirely with recycled materials.\n\nJustine heads south from Taos to Roswell, the site of a reported UFO crash in 1947. Justine investigates the incident, which has become shrouded in secrecy, and hears some convincing evidence about the case.\n\nJustine continues her journey by bike, stopping next at the small town of Deming, where she takes part in the Great American Duck Race. She then heads north west to Tucson, in the state of Arizona. Here she meets some cowboys and takes a horse ride through the desert. She also trades in the motorbike for a car and finds a fellow traveller to share costs on the way North to Sedona.\n\nWhen they reach the New Age capital of Sedona, Justine has a physic reading, and is told that her new car will break down in six to eight months time. The next day the car gets towed to the nearest garage, and Justine gets a lift to Peach Springs at the West rim of the Grand Canyon. She goes on a white water rafting trip, then takes to the skies in a helicopter to view this awesome natural beauty.\n\nAfter picking up her car again, it's an eighteen hour drive north-west via the bright lights of Vegas, to the Black Rock Desert. Here, Justine ends her journey at the Burning Man festival. All that is weird and wonderful can be found here, as Justine discovers, when she visits the smut shack, is offered frozen bugs, and joins the Pagan revellers for the burning of a forty foot neon man.",

Bwindi is one of the last remaining habitats of mountain gorillas in the world, and the current gorilla population is estimated at 320. With the help of guides and slashers who cut at the dense undergrowth with machetes, Nikki tracks a gorilla family for hours through difficult terrain and is finally rewarded when she finds herself only metres from a Silverback.\n\nNikki travels north through the wildlife haven Queen Elizabeth National Park, en route to the small town of Kasese. Kasese is situated at the base of the Rwenzori Mountains and is the last place where trekkers can buy provisions before setting off into the mountains. Nikki buys a pair of wellies for the infamous Bigo Bog and organises a team of Ugandan guides and porters to accompany her on the trek.\n\nThe Rwenzori Mountains are also known as The Mountains of the Moon because of the glaciers at the summit which can be glimpsed through a veil of cloud. They are a true African wilderness and Nikki treks through impossible undergrowth, along slippery paths, through knee deep bogs and thick mud, under towering giant heather forests and over snow covered peaks and glaciers, ending her journey a few hundred metres of Margherita Peak, the third highest in Africa.\n\nFor the final part of Nikki's journey she crosses the border into the Congo and travels to Beni, where she is diagnosed with Malaria. After a course of medical treatment and a few unplanned rest days, she heads off into the Ituri forest in Eastern Congo.\n\nShe travels in a truck along some of the worst roads in Africa; the recent rains have turned it into mud-filled potholes.\n\nLeaving the vehicle and setting off on foot Nikki eventually reaches a Mbuti Pygmy community. The pygmies are the indigenous people of the Ituri forest, which provides them with nearly everything they need.\n\nHere Nikki helps the children collect caterpillars and crabs for the evening meal, has ticks removed from her hair and on her final night is invited to listen to their traditional music.",

A three day battle using oranges for ammunition to commemorate the 12th century revolt against the tyrannical Count Rinari, who had his wicked way with all new brides, until a feisty miller’s daughter named Violetta beheaded him. Up to 100,000 contestants bombard the nobility represented in the carts paraded in the square. Teams are selected from the neighbourhoods in which they live, so rivalry is fierce!\n\nOn to Alba to discover the secrets of one of the world’s rarest gourmet delicacies, truffles, the fungal equivalent of gold. Setting off with a pack off trained dogs, she joins the hunt.\n\nNext stop is cosmopolitan capital Milan, she takes in the Duomo, which is the world’s largest statue adorned Gothic cathedral, and see the magnificent view of the alps. The cathedral contains one of Italy’s most prized holy relics, the Santo Quioto, a nail from the crucifix of Christ which is shown to the public just one day each year.\n\nMilan is one of the fashion capitals of the world and it seems like people here are impossibly stylish, in Quatrolatero Duoro - the Golden Square even the police uniform is made by Armani.\n\nFailing to get a ticket for the world famous opera house La Scala, Megan visits the burial ground of opera comopser Giuseppi Verdi where you can actually hear his music still filtering down.\n\nIt’s a short train journey to the magnificent Medieval towns of Parma, Modena, Mantua and Verona. She samples the local Parma ham and Parmesan cheese, a staple part of the local diet for 700 years and learns how to make Parmesan traditional in copper vats. In Modenello, home to the Ferrari dynasty she visits a Ferrari museum. In the lakeside city of Monteva she visits the Gonzagas palace of its most famed historic family and she experiences some of Italy’s greatest art works.\n\nFrom Monteva it’s a half hour train journey to Verona, the city of love nested on the banks of the curling Audeje river. She visits the balcony of Shakespeare’s Juliet and meets the woman who responds to the fictious Juliet’s many letters with advice on love for women.\n\nFrom Verona, Megan takes the train up to the Tyrolean mountain of Bolanzo, and catches a bus to the swanky ski resort of Portina del Fetso, where she feels out of place without the regulation fur coat!\n\nShe visits the Dolomites, some of the most spectacular mountains in the world whose 60 million year old corals reate their worn view and razor sharp peaks.\n\nIt’s a three hour train journey to Megan’s final destination, Venice the city of lust,which is the only city with rivers for roads in which a township has sprung from its muddy islands. She party’s at its strange historic carnival which dates back to 1094 and is moulded for a traditional carnival mask\n\nTo conclude her journey’s in Northern Italy, she visits St Marks Square and the Basilica church which housed the body of St Mark 1200 years ago.",

Situated in a lagoon in the Adriatic Sea off mainland Italy, this city built on water is a maze of over 100 tiny islands linked together by a network of bridges.\n\nThe way to explore Venice is either by boat or on foot - there are no cars in the city. Justine hops aboard a public waterbus, or vaporetto, that takes her along the Grand Canal to her evening's accommodation, an elegant palazzo with amazing views over the city.\n\nJustine begins her sight-seeing at the epicentre of Venice, St. Mark's Square. Napoleon described it as the 'the finest drawing room in Europe' but Justine finds it full of tourists and pigeons today. She marvels at the basilica, and its ornate mosaics that tell of how daring Venetians stole St. Mark's body from the Orient and brought it to the city for prestige and honour. As Justine leaves the main sights behind and explores Venice's backstreets she finds that it's all too easy to become lost in the labyrinthine alleyways, although she also discovers this is a perfect way to stumble upon hidden treasures.\n\nNo visit to Venice would be complete without a ride in a gondola; Justine gets a romantic ride and a cheeky insider's view on the city from pin-up gondolier Gianbattista.\n\n \t \t \n\nJustine takes a ten-minute boat ride from Venice across the lagoon to the island of The Lido for some glamour. It is the setting for the annual Venice Film Festival and she lines up with other tourists along the red carpet hoping for a glimpse and a chat with some of Hollywood's hottest stars.\n\nNext stop is Burano, a complete contrast to The Lido. This sleepy fishing village is famous for its brightly coloured houses and lace-making. Justine tries her hand at the intricate needlework with the help of an octogenarian islander.\n\nBack in Venice, Justine mingles with young Venetians at a popular bar and tries the local seafood tapas before taking an unusual night tour with the romantic city's most infamous lover and libertine, Casanova.\n\nThe following day, Justine heads to Doge's Palace. This palace, resplendent in gold and sumptuous oil paintings, was the political heart of the Republic of Venice. It was home to the city's elected leader, the Doge, and its Bridge of Sighs leads to the city's incarcerated.\n\nVenice's unique status of being built on water also means that it faces a precarious future, as the city is regularly prone to flooding. Justine takes a boat ride with a local scientist who explains how heavy water traffic and industry are threatening the equilibrium of the lagoon, and what counter-steps are being taken.\n\nBack on a boat on the Grand Canal, Justine completes her Venetian adventure - by taking part in one of the city's most colourful and joyful festivals - the annual Rowing Regatta. A flotilla of historic boats is followed by fast and furious racing to determine the city's speediest gondoliers.",

                    "overview": "The Indian Ocean Islands, off the east coast of Africa, are a paradise on earth. With superb resorts, sun-kissed beaches, and sparkling turquoise seas - countless Africans, Indians, Europeans, and even pirates, have all settled in this timeless, tropical location. From horse racing to hedgehog hunting and swimming with whale sharks, to the sheer indulgence of 6-star luxury hotels, traveller Ian Wright samples slow-paced island life at its best with a whole lot of action thrown in! Ian starts his trip in the Republic of Mauritius and the capital city Port-Louis, where he samples some delicious local fare at a street market and learns all about the Dodo in the place where these now extinct, flightless birds once made their home. Then it’s off to the Champ de Mars, the second oldest racecourse in the world, for 'a flutter' on the horses. Next stop is the Flacq region, where Ian stops off at the 6-star Touessrok Hotel to enjoy his racecourse winnings and indulge in a spot of pampering at one of the most luxurious hotels in the whole of the Indian Ocean. Never one to miss a trend, Ian discovers a lot of couples get married in Mauritius, and… just happens to bump into a couple who not only plan to hold their wedding ceremony 20 feet under the sea, but also invite Ian to be their best man! Leaving the underwater world behind, and the newly-weds to enjoy their honeymoon, Ian decides to get back to nature and go in for a spot of hedgehog hunting. He gets to tuck into his first tasty mouthful of a local delicacy called ‘tang’, otherwise known as hedgehog meat. He also makes the acquaintance of a 90-year old giant tortoise, not to mention a whole bunch of hungry crocodiles. And, as if that wasn’t adventurous enough, he heads to Reunion, the ‘Island of Adventure’ and takes to the hills to try his hand at canyoneering - an extreme adventure sport which involves abseiling, sliding, jumping, swimming and climbing down waterfalls and steep canyons. Then it’s time for a visit to one of the most active volcanoes on earth, Piton de la Fournaise. The next island Ian visits is Mahe in the Seychelles where big game fishing is big business. He sets off into the ocean with a group of locals in search of the perfect catch - they return to dry land, triumphant. After all the exuberance of the trip thus far, Ian makes off for for the tranquillity of idyllic La Digue, the most photographed beach in the world. What could be better than sitting on a beautiful beach, we ask ourselves? Owning one? Or maybe owning a whole tropical island, just like Yorkshire man, Brendon, who gives us a guided tour of the one he bought over 30 years ago for only US$14,000. A bargain. Last stop on the trip is another underwater adventure when Ian helps the local Marine Conservation Society seek out and tag whale sharks. Now under the watchful eye of a team of volunteers and marine biologists, these enormous animals are an endangered species. Ian spends a contented few hours splashing around with his new best friend, a seven metre long whale shark. Whatever you’re looking for, whether it's amazing marine life, spouting volcanoes, extreme adventure sports, luxurious relaxation, or picture postcard beaches - it’s all to be found in the Indian Ocean Islands. A real paradise on Earth.",

After kicking back on iconic Grace Bay Beach, he enjoys a spectacular dive and then tries out the local food speciality - an aphrodisiac - conch!\n\nHeading east, Ian’s next stop is North Caicos, where he learns about the island's heritage at the Wade's Green Slave Plantation and in town meets some real island characters, who he teaches how to say Hooman Bean.\n\nHe then takes a ferry to the neighbouring island of Middle Caicos, for a stunning trek along its wild and deserted north coast.\n\nOn South Caicos, Ian helps out on an environmental study of the lemon shark before ending his journey on Grand Turk - renowned for its beautiful colonial architecture - in search of majestic humpback whales.\n\n \n\nMILFORD TRACK, NEW ZEALAND\n\n \n\nZay Harding prepares to trek the Milford TrackWe then meet up with Zay Harding, who is hiking the Milford Track, the most famous and spectacular trekking route in New Zealand.\n\nTo reach the remote trailhead on the southwestern tip of the South Island, Zay sails in a traditional wooden ketch across beautiful Lake Te Anau, where he starts the 3-day trek up and over the MacKinnon Pass en route to the Milford Sound. \n\nOn day 1 of the trek, as Zay climbs up through the narrow Clinton River gorge, a continuous downpour of torrential rain creates hundreds of waterfalls which thunder down the towering cliffs of the gorge, causing a flood surge that forces Zay to wade up to his chest through fast-flowing waters in order to make it through to his overnight stop at the mountain lodge at the head of the gorge.\n\nOn day 2 the weather transforms for Zay's climb up and over the mountains.  Reaching the MacKinnon Pass in glorious sunshine, the summit of the trek at nearly 4,000 feet, Zay is rewarded with a magnificent 360 degree panorama of high mountain peaks surrounding him in every direction.\n\nOn day 3, and after a long trek thousands of feet down the other side of the mountains, Zay reaches the ocean, and the end of his trek - the Milford Sound, a dramatic fjord enclosed by sheer peaks plunging thousands of feet straight down into the water, has been called the eighth wonder of the world, and is a fitting climax to one of the finest treks on earth.",
