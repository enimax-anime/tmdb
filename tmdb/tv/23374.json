Even with all of his powers restored with the summoning of Suzaku, Tamahome is still considerably weaker than his adversary, and Miaka and her Celestial Warriors work to channel all of their powers to him. This plan is still insufficient to defeat Nakago, and as a last resort, Miaka decides to seal Seiryuu away using Suzaku's powers. Nakago loses all of his powers, and as Tamahome delivers his final blow, he glimpses Nakago's bitter past, his ascent to power, and his plight for revenge. The Suzaku Seven's final enemy falls at last, and they urge Miaka to use her final wish to ensure that she and Tamahome could stay together. However, her wish is to restore her world's peace and serenity, and Tamahome consents. Her mission fulfilled, Miaka and her Warriors say a tearful good-bye, and she shares a final kiss with Tamahome as the two worlds are separated and Miaka changed for the better. Days pass, and she discovers a letter which Tamahome had left for her. She learns of his promise to love her through all time and space, and his wish to find her again. Miaka and Yui eventually pass their high school entrance exams, and one school day, Keisuke leads them to a young man who is revealed to be Tamahome, still wearing his wedding ring. The story ends as Miaka lapses into tears of joy.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"1996-03-28","episode_number":52,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":1,"show_id":23374,"still_path":null},"name":"Fushigi Yugi: The Mysterious Play","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":98,"logo_path":"/1oTje9uOhRcuLSAc8ERn0cnG51i.png","name":"TV Tokyo","origin_country":"JP"}],"number_of_episodes":52,"number_of_seasons":1,"origin_country":["JP"],"original_language":"ja","original_name":"ふしぎ遊戯","overview":"Junior high school student Miaka lives a normal life in Tokyo until she finds a mysterious book in the library, and she and her friend Yui are transported the Universe of the Four Gods.
