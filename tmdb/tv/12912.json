It ran for one season in 1995.\n\nThe beginning of the series is much as in the novel. A group of refugees attempting to escape the American Civil War in a balloon wind up stranded on a remote Pacific island, where they are able to improvise a comfortable living for themselves while they wait for a passing ship. As time passes, they become suspicious that some unseen force is watching and directing their movements.\n\nThe main difference between the protagonists of the series and those of the novel is the addition of a female character, the wife of Pencroft.\n\nThe unseen watcher, Captain Nemo, is more active and less benevolent than in the novel. Able to monitor the island through steampunk-style closed-circuit television and other advanced devices, he treats the castaways as human laboratory specimens, influencing their environment to test their behaviour under stressful conditions. As the series progresses, his tests become more extreme as their continued co-operation threatens his preferred thesis that all humans are, at base, selfish and untrustworthy.\n\nIn the series finale, Nemo apparently succeeds in breaking up the group; this proves to be a ruse by the protagonists, who are now certain of Nemo's existence. After they penetrate his hideaway, Nemo admits that the 'experiment' is ruined, and offers to return the castaways to civilisation in his submarine. In a final twist, he puts out to sea without them, apparently leaving them alone on the island, without his influence for good or ill.","popularity":4.724,"poster_path":"/6yjPiOiIby5pPLGVdd9GTJrJupQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1995-06-15","episode_count":23,"id":23859,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/oYa5K4HRm2Zg4RR3BdDMRoIZjur.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52582456760ee36aaa7ea51e","air_date":"1995-06-15","episodes":[{"air_date":"1995-06-15","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":489757,"name":"Genesis","overview":"The Battle of Richmond, March 20, 1865: Captured by Confederate forces, the group escapes their captors and flees in a helium balloon.
