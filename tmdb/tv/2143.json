It tended to feature drama of a science fiction or supernatural bent. The series was created by Anna Home, then head of children's and youth programming at TVS, however production responsibilities were divided amongst most of the regional ITV franchise holders. Thus, each episode was in practice a one-off production with its own cast and crew, up to and including the executive producer.\n\nDramarama was largely a place for new talent to prove themselves and was a launching pad for the likes of Anthony Horowitz, Paul Abbott, Kay Mellor, Janice Hally, Tony Kearney, David Tennant and Ann Marie Di Mambro. It was one of Dennis Spooner's last credits.\n\nOne of Dramarama's episodes, \"Dodger, Bonzo And The Rest\", gained so much popularity that it was turned in to its own series the following year. It starred Lee Ross and was based around a large foster home. The episode \"Blackbird Singing In The Dead of Night\" was developed by Granada into the TV series Children's Ward. It was also repeated for the first time since its original broadcast on 5 January 2013, during CITV's 30th anniversary Old Skool Weekend. The Series 7 episode \"Back To Front\" – notable for featuring a mirror image of the Yorkshire Television logo card at the end – was repeated on 6 January 2013, again as part of CITV's 30th anniversary Old Skool Weekend.","popularity":6.29,"poster_path":"/xp6lpJWxmJUz1fpzkpybR5nTC7I.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1983-04-18","episode_count":9,"id":6543,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1983-09-12","episode_count":9,"id":6536,"name":"Season
