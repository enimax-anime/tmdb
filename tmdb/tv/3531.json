The series was designed after Comic Relief Does The Apprentice, a charity special of the British Apprentice series. This installment marks the series' return to New York after spending the previous season in Los Angeles and features abstract paintings by Seattle-based artist Maeve Harris. The series premiered on NBC on January 3, 2008 at 9:00PM.\n\nThis is the first season where the candidates did not reside in a communal penthouse of Trump Tower which was more as a meeting vicinity and also the boardroom. The celebrities lived in Trump International Hotel and Tower. There are also no traditionally given rewards to the winning team apart from the winning project manager receiving an amount of $20,000 along with available proceeds from the tasks to be donated to his or her favorite charity. Nevertheless, the firing rule remained. America's Got Talent judge Piers Morgan was the winner, beating country music singer Trace Adkins in the finals. Ironically, Morgan was the only celebrity fired during the original British celebrity edition of the show.",

Apex ran into a problem when the corner they chose was already occupied by a licensed vendor. Apex was forced to move to a new corner, but couldn't decide, so they split up in half. After passing by Mosaic's set up, Apex realized they should be together. Stacie J. was asked to give directions, and she made a mistake. Apex made $2,472.29; and Mosaic made $2,707.85. Mosaic was treated to champagne and caviar, and Apex was sent to the boardroom, where Bradford was fired for relinquishing his exemption from the boardroom..",

Still, Excel is able to just barely squeak by with a win, giving them the prize of dinner with the Donald, but Markus is not granted the usual exemption for being the winning Project Manager because his team does not vote for him to receive the privillege.

Thus, the teams are shaken up, and Capital Edge Project Manager Alla is left with Felisha, Adam, Markus, Randal, and Clay, while Excel team leader Josh is forced to lead Jennifer M, Rebecca, Mark, James, Brian, and Marshawn. The teams are then given the responsibiity of designing a display and event for Dick's sporting goods to move merchandise in a specific product category. Capital Edge picks golf and Excel selects baseball, but when the events begin, Excel forgets that their primary focus is supposed to be on sales, not event planning. The result?

Randal, meanwhile, is forced to move his event indoors and call off the baseball game, replacing it with a celebrity auction, putting several items up for bid.  Later in the boardroom, Rebecca receives criticism for not directly asking audience members of her comedy show to make donations to her charity, the Elizabeth Glaser Pediatric Aids Foundation, but Rebecca support her decision, saying that it is what the Yahoo executives specifically asked for.  Rebecca, however, is praised for her excellent event plans, with excellent Yahoo and Elizabeth Glaser signage throughout the room.  Randal gets some flak for his poorly-run event, for not checking the weather forecast, and for not having a Plan \"\"B,\"\" but is rewarded for raising awareness for the Autism Speaks chairty and raising $11,000.  With the final tasks over, Rebecca and Randal discuss their journey on the show, and prepare for the live finale.",

After the hiring, Trump asks his new employee for advice, in front of everyone: should he hire Rebecca as well?  Randal shoots that idea down with a shotgun, saying that he was picked as The Apprentice, and that there shouldn't be \"\"Apprentii.\"\"",

The series was designed after Comic Relief Does The Apprentice, a charity special of the British Apprentice series. This installment marks the series' return to New York after spending the previous season in Los Angeles and features abstract paintings by Seattle-based artist Maeve Harris. The series premiered on NBC on January 3, 2008 at 9:00PM.\n\nThis is the first season where the candidates did not reside in a communal penthouse of Trump Tower which was more as a meeting vicinity and also the boardroom. The celebrities lived in Trump International Hotel and Tower. There are also no traditionally given rewards to the winning team apart from the winning project manager receiving an amount of $20,000 along with available proceeds from the tasks to be donated to his or her favorite charity. Nevertheless, the firing rule remained. America's Got Talent judge Piers Morgan was the winner, beating country music singer Trace Adkins in the finals. Ironically, Morgan was the only celebrity fired during the original British celebrity edition of the show.",
