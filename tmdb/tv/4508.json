He is being blackmailed by Sweet, the head of Brother's Day, an anti-tech terrorist organization. They get Edmunds to work with them to lead them to Selig, unaware that Brother's Day has followed them to the hologrammatically concealed floating fortress where Zeta's creator is working to create semi-organic synthoids. Sweet plants an explosive as a disguised Zeta confronts his creator who confesses he secretly planted a \"conscience chip\" in Zeta (which Bennett overhears). Sweet triggers the explosion before Zeta can reveal who he is.

One of these is a young man named Kevin, who is confined to a wheelchair. The doctor has created a backpack device called a \"\"synaptic amplifier,\" which allows him to walk normally. Zeta and Ro sneak into the center disguised as Kevin and his backpack, but end up encountering a thief there to steal the real amplifier pack. On a non-handicapped person the pack provides them with fantastic strength and agility.
