Ben Stiller is executive co-producer.\n\nSeason 1 showcases fireman Mark Orlando as the bachelor. Season 2 of the series, which premiered in February 2013, stars June Diane Raphael reprising her role as season 1 contestant Julie, now the bachelorette given the chance to find the perfect man. Season 3 also premiered in 2013 and starred former contestants from Seasons 1 and 2 competing for a $900 prize rather than for love.","popularity":8.689,"poster_path":"/zVSpYSuACSvqLDBFL35ZmlWDzQU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32175,"logo_path":"/uDdRj9LplO4odapVo2XB39tW0wA.png","name":"Abominable Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":2932,"logo_path":"/4uLKLjGivVg2YnAIhAn8k7ZuVFj.png","name":"Red Hour","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":13,"id":53317,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2012-06-01","episode_count":14,"id":53318,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/9X4NoEbguQaUrMAngizkHB1heHo.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2013-02-14","episode_count":14,"id":53319,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/ot51Xg1VUw3L1dWCUA5ypsjvqf7.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2013-04-12","episode_count":14,"id":53320,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/vrWzQeCf8BZl7irX33YZLldNKO4.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":29,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525966f2760ee346619c1653","air_date":"2012-06-01","episodes":[{"air_date":"2012-06-01","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":892149,"name":"Meet Mark Orlando","overview":"Fireman Mark Orlando arrives at the Burning Love mansion to meet his future wife.
