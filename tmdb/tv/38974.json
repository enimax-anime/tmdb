In the real world, a guy named Brody asks Jessie out on a date, which actually causes Tony to become jealous, just like in the medieval story. Both of the boys go on a great medieval \"adventure\" in the story to try to get Jessie to be their princess. They joust for Jessie, but Tony is obviously weaker than Brody.
