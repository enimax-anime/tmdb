            "overview": "This series follows Mike Holmes and his son Mike Jr. (MJ) as they transform MJ's modest bachelor bungalow into the perfect, two-storey home for MJ and his girlfriend Lisa. While Mike and MJ share a last name, a strong work ethic, and a desire to help others, they don't always see eye to eye. Their different approaches provide the foundation for unexpected moments of humour and drama- though they always vow to build it right. In addition to seeing the newest materials and build techniques, viewers will get a glimpse into the personal lives of the Holmes men. Holmes + Holmes is a memorable Father/Son journey with a hammer...and a dream!",
