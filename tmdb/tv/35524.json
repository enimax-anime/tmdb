It consists of five episodes and covers the period from the death of his father, Pepin the Short in AD 768 until Charlemagne's corronation as the first Holy Roman Emperor on Christmas Day, AD 800. However, there is a minor chronological anachronism: in an earlier episode, we see Widukind, the king of the Saxons surrender and convert to Christianity, which didn't happen until AD 803.\n\nThis program was directed by Clive Donner and based primarily on the contemporary biography of Charlemagne written by Einhard, who knew Charlemagne personally.","popularity":4.898,"poster_path":"/efVoVtVAs2wgCcmqrKtvWzeqSXK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":31821,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pathé Télévision","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1080,"logo_path":"/6bZ0BiLDzCZSqVCjiSqweWwp9Ew.png","name":"Beta Film","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"LU","name":"Luxembourg"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1993-02-28","episode_count":3,"id":77455,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":9.3,"vote_count":3,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"574bfaf4925141676d000573","air_date":"1993-02-28","episodes":[{"air_date":"1993-02-28","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1196798,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"Prince Charles, known as Charlemagne or Charles the Great, was an aggressive ninth-century French ruler determined to increase his territory.","production_code":"","runtime":90,"season_number":1,"show_id":35524,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1994-02-27","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1196799,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"After conquering Europe, Charlemagne orders a common-language translation of the Bible and converts Saxon leader Widukind to Christianity.","production_code":"","runtime":90,"season_number":1,"show_id":35524,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1994-03-06","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"finale","id":1196801,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"For defending Rome against the Byzantines, Pope Leo III crowns Charlemagne ruler of the Holy Roman Empire.","production_code":"","runtime":90,"season_number":1,"show_id":35524,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":77455,"poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
