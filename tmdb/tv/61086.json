Host Adam Richman (\"Man v. Food\") will give homegrown amateur cooks the chance to test their skills against professional chefs. Every down-home cook has that one signature dish or secret family recipe that always gains favor with friends and family. Now, imagine going head-to-head in the kitchen against five professional chefs, who try to cook your specialty dish even better than you in the hopes of winning over a dinner party made up of the American public. With each savored victory, the cash prize gets bigger and bigger as the home cooks rise to every challenge and outcook the professional chefs. Think you've got what it takes to serve up the competition?","popularity":2.402,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26720,"logo_path":null,"name":"Electus","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2014-07-22","episode_count":8,"id":61961,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2015-07-02","episode_count":10,"id":68271,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Reality","vote_average":2,"vote_count":4,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"53cde3d4c3a368777a003c51","air_date":"2014-07-22","episodes":[{"air_date":"2014-07-22","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":998227,"name":"Elisha Joyce","overview":"In the series premiere, home cook Elisha Joyce puts her signature recipes to the test against five pro chefs - including Lorena Garcia!","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":61086,"still_path":"/jMVXOE4ouvXhMENwOCBpqYU0n7U.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-07-29","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":998228,"name":"Kena Peay","overview":"A single and unemployed home chef competes against culinary professionals -- including Cat Cora.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":61086,"still_path":"/3a1vIL54qfLCZ2wZire6Ex9497B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-08-05","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1001072,"name":"Annie Smith","overview":"Home cook Annie Smith battles five pro chefs in hopes of winning enough money to provide her daughter with a speech-generating device!","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":61086,"still_path":"/w4o7inkas4nh9gst0rkKWnZ0UCH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-08-12","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":1001073,"name":"Nick Evans","overview":"IT manager and home cook from Denver, Nick Evans, puts his best recipes to the test against five pro chefs -including Duff Goldman.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":61086,"still_path":"/wO6lkv3Jz56LMw7qsSsw00DuVCZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-08-19","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":1003990,"name":"Cortney Anderson-Sanford","overview":"Home cook Cortney Anderson-Sanford puts her best recipes to the test against five professional chefs, including Lorena Garcia, in an attempt to win $100,000.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":61086,"still_path":"/7HNDrFXQe3mkpwnqtHQ6s2xDld2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-08-26","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":1005236,"name":"Jon Coombs","overview":"An Army sergeant competes against culinary professionals -- including chef Cat Cora.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":61086,"still_path":"/omwkyUOzqc9odACjxvFTMW7REHw.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-09-02","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":1004673,"name":"Melissa Clinton","overview":"A high-school teacher faces off against notable culinarians.
