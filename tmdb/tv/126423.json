It traces his own search for identity and his role shaping a more inclusive American identity that has been under attack since he left office. Through the words of some of the people who knew him best, and through some of his sharpest critics, the film ultimately reveals the fallacy of America as a post-racial society, and confronts the work still needed to achieve a more perfect union as the work of a country, not just one man.","popularity":1.673,"poster_path":"/cx2oOEQHvNdrhTLdXrmoKzim2Xq.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":72946,"logo_path":"/bnK0eEBYKv7bf5m030ID30IoHRE.png","name":"Kunhardt Films","origin_country":"US"},{"id":14914,"logo_path":"/1RZBWz53SpHUTLpRcM8BGv2plIP.png","name":"HBO Documentary Films","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2021-08-03","episode_count":3,"id":196988,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/cx2oOEQHvNdrhTLdXrmoKzim2Xq.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"The challenge of change.","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":6,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"60ae692b1108a80029ec55a8","air_date":"2021-08-03","episodes":[{"air_date":"2021-08-03","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":2978682,"name":"Part 1","overview":"A look back at Obama's upbringing, his early days in Hawaii, and his pursuit of higher education at Columbia University and Harvard Law School.
