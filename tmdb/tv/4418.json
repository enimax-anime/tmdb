Teams travel across the United States and Europe in search of seven \"artifacts\" which when assembled will \"lead to the key. Find the key, and find the treasure.\" The challenges and puzzles are spliced with American history, and the ultimate goal is to find a hidden treasure, leading the show to be compared on various occasions to the film National Treasure. The value of the treasure in the series was revealed on the season finale to be $3,000,000.\n\nThe two-hour premiere episode aired on June 18, 2006 and beginning June 26 the series moved to its regular Monday night timeslot. The season finale was broadcast live on August 21, 2006.\n\nThe Hunt is similar in format to The Amazing Race. Key differences include:\n\n⁕Teams consist of three members as opposed to The Amazing Race's usual two\n\n⁕The start location of each leg is not necessarily the end point of the previous leg\n\n⁕Teams start each leg at the same time; Amazing Race teams have staggered starts based on previous leg finish order","popularity":3.193,"poster_path":"/wNeqnRuGCYuXRPdKMBs4kzEeCzy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7378,"logo_path":null,"name":"Magical Elves","origin_country":"US"},{"id":52032,"logo_path":null,"name":"Madison Road Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":2850,"logo_path":"/wLBnXtbPu2pESrTtB1hbp3MK9Px.png","name":"Imagine Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2006-06-18","episode_count":11,"id":13185,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Reality","vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52576895760ee36aaa3aaed3","air_date":"2006-06-18","episodes":[{"air_date":"2006-06-18","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":307531,"name":"Series Premiere","overview":"Laird Macintosh hosts this fast-paced adventure/mystery reality series where multi-player teams try to stay one step ahead of each other as they travel to historically significant locations around the globe and are mentally and physically challenged in their quest of a promised hidden treasure.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":4418,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2006-06-26","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":307539,"name":"Bend the Light","overview":"To find the second of seven artifacts that will lead them to the treasure, the remaining nine teams must crack the secret code of Lewis & Clark as they follow in their footsteps through the American West.
