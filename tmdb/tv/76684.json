Hungry wolves are struggling to bring down their elk prey in the unusually shallow snow. And for great grey owls, it is the iciness of the snow that is hampering their hunts.

Kate Humble gets to grips with the science behind this remarkable season, from understanding the importance of the snowpack's structure as the melt begins to uncovering why Yellowstone's unique geology poses problems for some grazer's teeth.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":76684,"still_path":"/m4syHGPcjCqv4xEep5GaC2Jwt8h.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2017-01-04","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1424601,"name":"The Toughest Spring","overview":"The story of animals surviving one of the harshest seasonal changes on the planet continues.
