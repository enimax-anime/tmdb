The series was set in Laramie, Wyoming during 1879 and the 1880s. Warner Bros. already had several western series on the air at the time, having launched Cheyenne with Clint Walker as early as 1955. The studio continued the trend in 1957 with the additions of Maverick with James Garner and Jack Kelly, Colt .45 with Wayde Preston, and Sugarfoot with Will Hutchins. One year later, Warner Bros. added Lawman and Bronco with Ty Hardin.\n\nPrior to the beginning of production, Russell and Brown and producer Jules Schermer made a pact to maintain the quality of the series so that it would not be seen as \"just another western.\" At the start of season two, Russell and Brown were joined by Peggie Castle as Lily Merrill, the owner of the Birdcage Saloon, and a love interest for Dan.","popularity":24.512,"poster_path":"/18XzHfhbRKw9Cl8cKH7WkV9yjYr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1958-10-05","episode_count":39,"id":25095,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1959-10-04","episode_count":37,"id":25097,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1960-09-18","episode_count":39,"id":25096,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1961-09-17","episode_count":41,"id":25098,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.375,"vote_count":8,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52582bf8760ee36aaa885ebd","air_date":"1958-10-05","episodes":[{"air_date":"1958-10-05","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":508199,"name":"The Deputy","overview":"In this pilot episode, Dan Troop takes over in Laramie after the previous marshal is killed.
