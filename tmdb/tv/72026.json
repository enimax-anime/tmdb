Based on a compatibility calculation, young people at the age of 16 are assigned marriage partners by the government, with severe repercussions awaiting those who disobey the arrangement. For Yukari Nejima, a teen that considers himself average in every way, this system might be his best shot at living a fulfilling life.\n\nHowever, spurred by his infatuation for his classmate and long-time crush, Misaki Takasaki, Yukari defies the system and confesses his love. After some initial reluctance, Misaki reciprocates his feelings in a moment of passion. Unfortunately, before the two can further their relationship, Yukari receives his marriage notice. He is then thrown into a confusing web of love and lies when his less-than-thrilled assigned partner, Ririna Sanada, becomes fascinated with his illicit romance.","popularity":18.785,"poster_path":"/ejqfETzpBBnR89btARDKrLsv8dp.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":42521,"logo_path":"/pQfzDuY4chOVbSmsurvB9MHFsYa.png","name":"LIDENFILMS","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2018-11-16","episode_count":1,"id":117915,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/3Lre5Nrb7E0oOl9M4vM2cuoqSi.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2017-07-04","episode_count":12,"id":88956,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/rP1rTVbH8flZZd2Fbj7UEy7ptRL.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.6,"vote_count":32,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"593305119251417ddc010ae9","air_date":"2017-07-04","episodes":[{"air_date":"2017-07-04","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1323935,"name":"First Love","overview":"Yukari Nejima has been in love with Misaki Tazaki since grade school.
