It was created by John Lee and Vernon Chatman of PFFR. The show is rated TV-MA.\n\nThe show's format is that of educational PBS children's television shows such as Sesame Street and The Electric Company, parodying the format with adult-oriented content. In addition to general controversial comedy, it satirizes politics, religion, war, sex, and culture with black comedy.\n\nEvery episode begins with a disclaimer, accompanied by the sound of someone screaming \"Don't eat my baby!\", which reads:\n\n\"Wonder Showzen contains offensive, despicable content that is too controversial and too awesome for actual children. The stark, ugly and profound truths Wonder Showzen exposes may be soul-crushing to the weak of spirit.
