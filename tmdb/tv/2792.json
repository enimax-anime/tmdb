The show's format is somewhat similar to the CBS television series Survivor, though with a teenaged cast. Endurance contestants live in a remote location and participate in various mental and physical challenges, although Endurance contestants compete as pairs, and the outcome of the competitions determines which pair of players is eliminated.\n\nIn its six-year run between 2002–2008, each season began with a new slate of contestants, who were gradually eliminated as the season progressed until the remaining two teams competed to get all of the Endurance Pyramid pieces. The winning boy and girl received an all-expenses paid vacation package with their parents to an exotic location as the prize.\n\nProduction ended with the final episode of the sixth season, first aired on March 8, 2008. Reruns of Endurance continue to be televised in the U.S., on Hub Network, Discovery Kids's successor until July 22, 2013. Reruns on the Hub ended on October 14, 2011, until the show was brought back for reruns on April 2, 2012 but was once again cancelled. Spanish-dubbed reruns also air on weekends on Azteca America. Three seasons of Endurance were each nominated for a Daytime Emmy Award in the category of \"Outstanding Children's Series\", however the show never won.","popularity":4.529,"poster_path":"/gQBOsZQFWlmDV8OP6WUGkB65EZU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2002-10-05","episode_count":16,"id":9056,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2003-09-27","episode_count":16,"id":9055,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2004-09-04","episode_count":21,"id":9054,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2005-10-01","episode_count":15,"id":9057,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2006-10-14","episode_count":15,"id":9058,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2007-10-13","episode_count":13,"id":9059,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":6,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Reality","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5257449f760ee36aaa0ed122","air_date":"2002-10-05","episodes":[{"air_date":"2002-10-05","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":216626,"name":"Right To Stay","overview":"\"\"Endurance\"\" begins as 20 kids arrive on an island in the Pacific Ocean on an 82 foot ship.
