In interviews, the group has mentioned that they were offered a third season by MTV but were unable to complete it due to Ansari's commitments to the hit NBC show Parks and Recreation. However, the group has stated that MTV has left the door open for the group to complete a third season at a later date or to produce a special for the network. In 2010, Ansari, Huebel and Scheer reunited to do a skit for the 2010 MTV Movie Awards.\n\nIn November 2008, The Hollywood Reporter noted the group is currently developing a feature film with Red Hour Productions, the production company run by Ben Stiller and producer Stuart Cornfeld.","popularity":12.484,"poster_path":"/vEuSf6Ur9EobO1i2vW5VJJJHQyr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":36,"id":14332,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2007-04-05","episode_count":8,"id":14331,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/hXrDxPWvLGr0BSKEwdMfrfQrL0Z.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2008-03-11","episode_count":6,"id":14330,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/kuWRvrKdYCLQOwPJJRqm5MgWRWl.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":19,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525779e619c29531db1c03c6","air_date":"2007-04-05","episodes":[{"air_date":"2007-04-05","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":341898,"name":"Mind Explosion","overview":"Pilot episode of the twisted sketch show featuring Aziz Ansari, Rob Huebel, and Paul Scheer.
