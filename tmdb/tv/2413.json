The series was a spinoff of The Andy Griffith Show, and the pilot was aired as the finale of the fourth season of The Andy Griffith Show on May 18, 1964. The show ran for five seasons and a total of 150 episodes. In 2006, CBS Home Entertainment began releasing the series on DVD. The final season was released in November 2008.\n\nThe series was created by Aaron Ruben, who also produced the show with Sheldon Leonard and Ronald Jacobs. Filmed and set in California, it stars Jim Nabors as Gomer Pyle, a naive but good-natured gas-station attendant from the town of Mayberry, North Carolina, who enlists in the United States Marine Corps. Frank Sutton plays Gomer's high-octane, short-fused Gunnery Sergeant Vince Carter, and Ronnie Schell plays Gomer's friend Gilbert \"Duke\" Slater. Allan Melvin played in the recurring role of Gunnery Sergeant Carter's rival, Sergeant Charley Hacker. The series never discussed nor addressed the then-current Vietnam War, instead focusing on the relationship between Gomer and Sergeant Carter. The show retained high ratings throughout its run.","popularity":157.269,"poster_path":"/Wy1SoeKjUiOQ48sXQi40DJupoZ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1964-09-25","episode_count":30,"id":7583,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/aAMWSrpn6ByicTmRMuTEVbwjNOu.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1965-09-17","episode_count":30,"id":7586,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/yoDh25YiOp11knJWRhsSZwz65xA.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1966-09-14","episode_count":30,"id":7584,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/sIzAOvXIqDr6tCuyoVtu0idHabk.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1967-09-08","episode_count":30,"id":7582,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/8ajjzIEFMD5XaW5TDRMIGMWnFUC.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0.5},{"air_date":"1968-09-27","episode_count":30,"id":7585,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/wTRFX6AIpuq6snVHh0LUDLSNWDR.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.173,"vote_count":26,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52573657760ee3776a3bac3a","air_date":"1964-09-25","episodes":[{"air_date":"1964-09-25","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":182077,"name":"Gomer Overcomes the Obstacle Course","overview":"Gomes tries to pass the obstacle course to please Sgt.
