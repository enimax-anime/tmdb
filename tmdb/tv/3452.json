Just as they enter the parking garage, Frasier suddenly realizes that the clock in his car is incorrect and that he is going to be late for his show. He enters the garage, then immediately leaves. He is furious when the attendant says that he owes two dollars (the fee for parking for twenty minutes or less), and decides to park his car at the gate until his twenty minutes is complete. He refuses to allow Niles to pay for him because he thinks he is taking an important stand. All of the motorists become irate because Frasier is keeping them trapped in the garage. Niles disagrees with Frasier, but reluctantly stays with him to show his support. Even after he is offered several chances to leave without paying, Frasier refuses to move. The attendant calls a tow truck, and is prepared to bring in the police. Niles points out that Frasier has a habit of being stubborn and trying to force everyone to agree with him. He finally persuades him to leave before the twenty minutes is up. As he pays, Frasier gets himself in more trouble with a long-winded speech. Roz must fill in for Frasier while he is at the garage. After Kenny encourages her to take some calls, her advice to one caller inadvertently exposes the fact that she slept with Frasier. Meanwhile, Eddie has an unusual reaction as Daphne moves the rest of her belongings out of Frasier's apartment. She realizes how much Martin is going to miss her, and sets up a regular outing for the three of them.","production_code":"","runtime":24,"season_number":10,"show_id":3452,"still_path":"/5titYhSBJJIEo3G7M5H1CnWiFov.jpg","vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525750f7760ee36aaa1b9add","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1214535,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lori Kirkland Baker","original_name":"Lori Kirkland Baker","popularity":1.164,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525750e6760ee36aaa1b81a5","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelsey Grammer","original_name":"Kelsey Grammer","popularity":21.686,"profile_path":"/cjUCogoFRnFKAgeyRmGGpekz0TF.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"George","credit_id":"52575130760ee36aaa1bfcf5","order":627,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40481,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Luis Guzmán","original_name":"Luis Guzmán","popularity":20.449,"profile_path":"/kSdxUckOJj9R5VKrLUnRy14YhNV.jpg"},{"character":"Motorist #1","credit_id":"58dd1107c3a36822ae00bbc3","order":1355,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":179976,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Kim","original_name":"Karen Kim","popularity":1.061,"profile_path":"/3yPUUo6u1MkDEYTivagen4Tp0xN.jpg"},{"character":"Motorist #2","credit_id":"58dd111392514140f600bc14","order":1357,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1380317,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Pasqualini","original_name":"Tony Pasqualini","popularity":2.249,"profile_path":"/55ZBvNayQB8L0MJOOAyKIxTjd3N.jpg"},{"character":"Motorist #3","credit_id":"58dd1127c3a368228a00ad27","order":1358,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damian D.

Martin agrees to go along with this, so long as Frasier promises to help arrange for wider parking spaces in the garage.  Martin is elected and becomes an immensely popular president, but soon grows tired of Frasier calling all the shots.  After Frasier doesn't immediately make good on his promise for the wider spaces, Martin backs out of the deal, as he believes that he can run the board on his own.  He soon finds that he is in over his head, as residents become annoyed with the complications created by the new spaces.  Frasier covers for him, so Martin publicly gives him credit for his ideas.  The board members turn on Frasier and accuse him of using his father, prompting an angry Martin to quit as a show of support for Frasier.  Meanwhile, Daphne begins to study in the hopes of passing her citizenship test.  Niles and Daphne tease Roz relentlessly after a misunderstanding over a fruit salad causes her to believe they are asking her to engage in a threesome.","production_code":"","runtime":24,"season_number":10,"show_id":3452,"still_path":"/gYZJSI5YC6cGxS1khX9Y5r6aZJ6.jpg","vote_average":7.667,"vote_count":3,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52575128760ee36aaa1becb1","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1234029,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Cynthia J.

Roz's younger cousin Jen comes to stay with her for the week.  She is extremely cynical and opinionated, and quickly gets on Frasier's nerves.  Jen remembers Roz as a fun and energetic person, so Roz has to go out partying with her every night so that her cousin will not think she has become boring.  However, their outings quickly leave Roz worn out and longing for sleep.  After Jen sets off Frasier by putting down Sigmund Freud, Roz sends her off with Kenny while she tries to calm Frasier.  Kenny and Jen, surprisingly, take a liking to one another.  Kenny admits that he longs to escape from his humdrum life and see the world.  He expresses an interest in joining Jen on her planned trip to Vietnam, but she says that she always travels alone.  A weary Roz tells Jen to stop trying to goad her into acting like she is still twenty.  She goes off on a tirade to a caller who doesn't want to commit to his girlfriend, and states that there is nothing wrong with acting one's age.

Meanwhile, Daphne ruins Martin's enjoyment of The Rockford Files when she says that he reminds her of Rockford's father, rather than the title character.","production_code":"","runtime":24,"season_number":10,"show_id":3452,"still_path":"/oSZnEcU1QMampHzv4vhCuDcdtrW.jpg","vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257511e760ee36aaa1bdef8","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":169288,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Ellis","original_name":"Scott Ellis","popularity":2.701,"profile_path":"/eSXSVDl8ehg4qo4kHEKV5NY1CVs.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Receptionist","credit_id":"52575129760ee36aaa1bee71","order":622,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75316,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Sparks","original_name":"Hal Sparks","popularity":8.224,"profile_path":"/sxmESxUf1nFEwheqXAtYDUMJP2s.jpg"},{"character":"Reservationist","credit_id":"52575129760ee36aaa1beeab","order":750,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":164945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Shahi","original_name":"Sarah Shahi","popularity":42.248,"profile_path":"/crKD1ax5wRRZ4QM7nQyH8K2deaA.jpg"},{"character":"Esthetician","credit_id":"52575129760ee36aaa1beee5","order":824,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":159431,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Annie Wersching","original_name":"Annie Wersching","popularity":24.789,"profile_path":"/xOTYKQp0pn7Q1XBgtbzo2yj6uWd.jpg"},{"character":"Facialist","credit_id":"52575129760ee36aaa1bef1f","order":862,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1225809,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monica McSwain","original_name":"Monica McSwain","popularity":5.873,"profile_path":"/a5UoAi1HZn5sZeU3I6m9CkV58wW.jpg"},{"character":"Attendant","credit_id":"58dd1bffc3a368228300bd39","order":1400,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"W.

However, Daphne notes that every event the brothers host inevitably ends in disaster.  She suggests that Niles instead host the party with her.  Frasier is hurt to learn that he will be excluded, and says that he will not even attend the party.  Daphne believes that she has everything under control, but things quickly begin to unravel.  Alice writes her name in crayon on the painting.  Daphne remains calm, and gives Roz the name of a man whom Niles uses to restore artwork.  However, the game hens catch fire in the meantime.  The caterers are too busy to replace them, so Daphne must turn to Frasier for help.  He comes over to assist with the food preparation, but must hide in the pantry whenever Niles comes in the kitchen so that his role will remain a secret.  Frasier becomes angry when he overhears Niles and others complimenting the food and saying how much better off they are without Frasier's involvement.  Mike Shaw, the artist responsible for the painting, shows for the party after earlier declining his invitation.  He doesn't care for the stuffy guests, and decides to go upstairs and watch pay-per-view boxing with Mrs. Moon.  Niles hears a couple's description of Shaw (white-haired man in a flannel shirt using a cane) and assumes they have him confused with Martin.  The couple who met Shaw has to leave.  Martin arrives to bring Frasier some dishes, and winds up having to pose as Shaw for the other guests.  Roz asks Daphne to stall the unveiling because the art restorer is painfully slow.  Niles insists that dinner must be served immediately.  He discovers Frasier, and they begin to argue, leading to more chaos.  Daphne tries her best to salvage the evening, but an unexpected event prompts her to give up.  Frasier consoles her by telling her that the disastrous party means she is officially part of the family.","production_code":"","runtime":24,"season_number":10,"show_id":3452,"still_path":"/zT28sNlYmrXZSQuplJ6g38y3L4s.jpg","vote_average":8,"vote_count":3,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525750fa760ee36aaa1ba3c0","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1212909,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Katy Garretson","original_name":"Katy Garretson","popularity":1.832,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Gertrude Moon","credit_id":"58dc7c21c3a368223e002d16","order":1192,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":162896,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Millicent Martin","original_name":"Millicent Martin","popularity":10.102,"profile_path":"/thRIWICkmqm1ejtDPrGGbCSeRug.jpg"},{"character":"Alice Doyle","credit_id":"58dc8d12c3a3682293003c8b","order":1287,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1786425,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ashley Thomas","original_name":"Ashley Thomas","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Mike Shaw","credit_id":"58ddbcafc3a3687c67001ecb","order":1389,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3907,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harve Presnell","original_name":"Harve Presnell","popularity":8.444,"profile_path":"/m512mz6ubYzBh4LjSnN3yHVuMwq.jpg"},{"character":"Antonia","credit_id":"58ddbcc19251411bbc001f6e","order":1391,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":59260,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ann Cusack","original_name":"Ann Cusack","popularity":13.006,"profile_path":"/vM2ZwKY3C1NZARrzQB7ch7n638T.jpg"},{"character":"Alex","credit_id":"58ddbccec3a3687c6f001c1b","order":1394,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":36189,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Schulze","original_name":"Paul Schulze","popularity":13.05,"profile_path":"/rT7RXbJ89XwIKmSkymEE4BhyIlk.jpg"},{"character":"Jeremy","credit_id":"58ddbcda9251411bbc001f87","order":1397,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63537,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Scotch Ellis Loring","original_name":"Scotch Ellis Loring","popularity":1.797,"profile_path":"/qIvaaeBTZWwtJxJfBqpM4xBnwXE.jpg"},{"character":"Thad","credit_id":"58ddbce6c3a3687c7d001e43","order":1402,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":157067,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matthew Yang King","original_name":"Matthew Yang King","popularity":6.861,"profile_path":"/jcLJIw0s2uP4PSnH5E8oM3pUyiV.jpg"},{"character":"Bill","credit_id":"58ddbd149251411ba6001c99","order":1405,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Lawford","original_name":"Christopher Lawford","popularity":3.118,"profile_path":"/4QZlqjbYQD6MnwCoJKGt4aq5Fku.jpg"},{"character":"Sharon","credit_id":"58ddbd22c3a3687c6f001c54","order":1408,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":74070,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nana Visitor","original_name":"Nana Visitor","popularity":14.056,"profile_path":"/nxQz38SIweupYuHdcsYvGn1v58H.jpg"},{"character":"Mr. Slobodkin","credit_id":"58ddbd31c3a3687c45001d31","order":1410,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105390,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Booth Colman","original_name":"Booth Colman","popularity":3.691,"profile_path":"/hB0mszIR6KeexXzqfHBOKbHYqv7.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2003-02-18","episode_number":15,"episode_type":"standard","id":249778,"name":"Trophy Girlfriend","overview":"Tired of being humiliated in his club's annual squash tournament, Niles ditches Frasier and pairs with a younger partner.

Avery says that Frasier's spending habits are out of control.  Frasier becomes depressed and heads out to Cafe Nervosa to think about a solution.  He is disgusted to discover that the owner has hired an eccentric folk singer to perform every afternoon.  He announces that he will no longer frequent the cafe, and forces a reluctant Niles to leave with him.  They scour Seattle in the hopes of finding a new hangout.  While at one prospect, they run into Julia.  This prompts them to leave in a hurry, but Frasier returns and sees Julia kissing Avery.  He agonizes over whether to tell her that Avery is married.  Niles returns to Cafe Nervosa and tries to keep it a secret from Frasier.  Frasier, frustrated by his inability to find a new coffeehouse, returns to Nervosa and catches Niles dancing along to Ben's performance.  Ben's song intro (about doing the right thing) inspires Frasier to confront Avery.  Much to his surprise, Julia is hiding in the closet.  She had known all along that Avery was married.  A disgusted Frasier declares that he will stop trying to be a friend to her.  Julia seems saddened when Avery takes a call from his wife.  She realizes that Frasier was trying to help her, and shows her appreciation by getting Ben a job at a bank so that he can no longer perform at Nervosa.  Meanwhile, a woman observes Daphne's therapy techniques with Martin to help determine whether Daphne can take on other clients.

Leland also shares many habits--and a couple of very rare allergies--with Niles.  Roz begins to worry that Leland was the boys' real father.  She accidentally shares her suspicions with Martin, who admits that Hester cheated on him and fears that Roz may be right.
