        "overview": "The Metropolitan Police try to identify a suspect accused of killing a man and shooting a policeman in Brazil back in November 1994. Detective Sergeant Pete Rance is working on another unusual case. The man he is looking for is wanted in connection with one of the most notorious match-fixing scandals in the history of cricket. And Martin Evans's incredible scam convinced dozens of people to invest in a dodgy ostrich farm. After going on the run to avoid prison, Evans reinvented himself as an international drug smuggler and is believed to have made more than Â£37 million. His flight from justice took him to Cyprus and South Africa, where he was eventually arrested. Evans was finally jailed for 21 years for fraud and drug trafficking. At a Johannesburg court, a judge ordered his extradition.",

In London, DS Pete Rance and his team are faced with a challenge. A Turkish man convicted of death by dangerous driving should be going home. He is due to board a plane at Heathrow, but he is refusing to leave his flat. Will the officers manage to get him extradited?",

His flight from justice took him to Cyprus and South Africa, where he was eventually arrested. Evans was finally jailed for 21 years for fraud and drug trafficking.
