The serial was directed by Tom Hooper, produced by Louis Marks, and was first broadcast in three parts on BBC One from 23 November to 7 December 2002. The serial starred Hugh Dancy as Daniel Deronda, Romola Garai as Gwendolen Harleth, Hugh Bonneville as Henleigh Grandcourt, and Jodhi May as Mirah Lapidoth. Co-production funding came from WGBH Boston.\n\nLouis Marks originally wanted to make a film adaptation of the novel but abandoned the project after a lengthy and fruitless casting process. The drama took a further five years to make it to television screens. Filming ran for 11 weeks from May to August on locations in England, Scotland and Malta. The serial was Marks' final television production before his death in 2010.","popularity":5.916,"poster_path":"/cytQ4yNq15TSllNnrtBJwgprVar.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":10197,"logo_path":"/lRah8iyzBZJ90ZgsKUIWUU9XnRu.png","name":"WGBH","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2002-11-23","episode_count":4,"id":45286,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/MspKPs2PrSZc3XgWJXQIuFW9Bh.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.9,"vote_count":34,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258d8f4760ee34661720395","air_date":"2002-11-23","episodes":[{"air_date":"2002-11-23","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":787960,"name":"Part One","overview":"Daniel sees Gwendolen Harleth in instantly knows that he wants to see her more.\n\nLater, Daniel decides that he wishes to leave University in order to go to Germany to pursue his love, Gwen.\n\nAfter being in Germany Daniel returns to England and saves a young woman named Mirah from drowning herself.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":34539,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5258d8f5760ee346617203f3","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Hooper","original_name":"Tom Hooper","popularity":3.188,"profile_path":"/wRuokdzGiSh2MHd9cYQQ9KGVFFj.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5258d8f5760ee346617203e3","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9156,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Davies","original_name":"Andrew Davies","popularity":6.565,"profile_path":"/gOxUTVdqNinS2KQvEyIAMKPKt6s.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2002-11-30","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":787961,"name":"Part Two","overview":"Daniel continues looking for Mirah's family and meets a man who could be her brother called Ezra Cohen.\n\nGrandcourt tells Gwen lies about Daniel in order to get her to think badly of him.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":34539,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5258d8f5760ee346617203f3","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70500,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tom Hooper","original_name":"Tom Hooper","popularity":3.188,"profile_path":"/wRuokdzGiSh2MHd9cYQQ9KGVFFj.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5258d8f5760ee346617203e3","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9156,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Davies","original_name":"Andrew Davies","popularity":6.565,"profile_path":"/gOxUTVdqNinS2KQvEyIAMKPKt6s.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2002-12-07","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":787962,"name":"Part Three","overview":"Meanwhile, Daniel discovers that Mordecai is Mirah's long-lost brother, Ezra.
