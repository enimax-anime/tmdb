    "overview": "The X Factor is an Australian television reality music competition, based on the original UK series, to find new singing talent. The first series of the show was broadcast from February to May, however, since the second series it has been broadcast from July/August until the grand final in November. The X Factor is produced by FremantleMedia Australia, and is currently broadcast on the Seven Network. The title \"X Factor\" refers to a singing talent which is \"unique\" and \"something\" that makes for star quality. Network Ten held rights for The X Factor in 2005, but dropped the show after the first series due to poor ratings. In 2010, the Seven Network went into a \"bidding war\" to gain rights for the show, and later won and a second series went into production. The X Factor was renewed after a highly successful Australian Idol was no longer broadcast through Network Ten. It is also broadcast in New Zealand on TV3. Two series of The Xtra Factor were broadcast through Network Ten in 2005 and 7Two in 2010. The show was not renewed for a third series in 2011.\n\nThe original judging panel line-up in 2005 consisted of Kate Ceberano, Mark Holden, and John Reid. When the show was revived in 2010, the judging panel was replaced by Ronan Keating, Guy Sebastian, Natalie Imbruglia, and Kyle Sandilands. Imbruglia and Sandilands did not return for series three and were replaced by Melanie Brown and Natalie Bassingthwaighte. Dannii Minogue and Redfoo joined the panel in the fifth series as replacements for Brown and Sebastian. During the televised audition phases of The X Factor, originally the contestants sang in an \"audition room\" in front of just the judges, however, from series two onwards all auditionees sing on stage in an arena, in front of the judges and a live audience. The successful acts then progress to the next stage of the competition, \"bootcamp\" and later \"home visits\", where the judges narrow their category down to three acts who will continue to the live shows, where the public vote for their favourite act, following weekly performances by the contestants.",

            "overview": "The X Factor is an Australian television reality music competition, based on the original UK series, to find new singing talent; the winner of which receives a recording contract with record label Sony Music Australia. The second series premiered on the Seven Network on 30 August 2010 and ended on 22 November 2010. The winner was Altiyan Childs and his debut single \"Somewhere in the World\" was released after the final. Childs was mentored throughout by Ronan Keating, who won as mentor for the first time. The series was presented by Luke Jacobz, while spin-off show The Xtra Factor was hosted by Natalie Garonzi on 7Two. The show was originally to be hosted by actor Matthew Newton, however, he was forced to withdraw as host during production after an altercation with his former girlfriend Rachael Taylor and re-admitting himself to rehab. Natalie Imbruglia, Guy Sebastian, Ronan Keating and Kyle Sandilands joined the judging panel as replacements for former judges, Mark Holden, John Reid and Kate Ceberano.\n\nThe competition was split into several stages: auditions, bootcamp, judges' houses and live shows. Auditions took place throughout May and June 2010. After the auditions was bootcamp, where successful acts were split into four categories: Under 25 Boys, Under 25 Girls, Over 25s and Groups. Each judge was given a category to mentor and had to decide on their twelve acts after day two, and their six acts after day two. Special guest judges, including Havana Brown, Rebecca Batties, Mark Plunkett and Rai Thistlethwayte were brought in to help the judges decide their acts. Following bootcamp, was the judges' houses stage, where each of the judges reduced their six acts to three, with help from more guest judges, including Kelly Rowland, Sir Richard Branson, Boyzone, Snoop Dogg and Usher. The live shows began on 19 September 2010.",

            "overview": "The X Factor is an Australian television reality music competition, based on the original UK series, to find new singing talent; the winner of which receives a management contract and a Sony Music Australia recording contract. The third series premiered on the Seven Network on 29 August 2011 and ended on 22 November 2011. The winner was Reece Mastin and his debut single \"Good Night\" was released after the final. Mastin was mentored throughout by Guy Sebastian, who won as mentor for the first time. The season was presented by Luke Jacobz. Sebastian and Ronan Keating were the only judges from the previous series who returned, while Natalie Bassingthwaighte and Melanie Brown joined the judging panel as replacements for former judges, Natalie Imbruglia and Kyle Sandilands.\n\nThe competition was split into several stages: auditions, bootcamp, home visits and live shows. Auditions in front of the show's producers took place throughout March and April 2011. The successful auditionees chosen by the producers were then invited back to the last set of auditions that took place in front of the judges and a live studio audience during May and June. After the auditions was bootcamp, where successful acts were split into four categories: Under 25 Boys, Under 25 Girls, Over 25s and Groups. Each judge was given a category to mentor and had to decide on their twelve acts after day two, and their six acts after day three. Special guest judges, including Wynter Gordon, Stephen Belafonte, Darren Hayes and The Veronicas, were brought in to help the judges decide their acts. Following bootcamp was the home visits stage, where each of the judges reduced their six acts to three, with help from more guest judges, including Beyoncé Knowles, Mel C, Jason Derülo, Good Charlotte and Leona Lewis. The live shows began on 19 September 2011.",

            "overview": "The X Factor is an Australian television reality music competition, based on the original UK series, to find new singing talent; the winner of which receives a Sony Music Australia recording contract and a new car. The fourth series premiered on the Seven Network on 20 August 2012 and ended on 20 November 2012. The winner was Samantha Jade and her winner's single \"What You've Done to Me\" was released after the final. Jade was mentored throughout by Guy Sebastian, who won as mentor for the second year in a row. The main live shows was presented by Luke Jacobz, while series three finalist Johnny Ruffo presented the digital live streaming show The X Stream. Sebastian, Ronan Keating, Natalie Bassingthwaighte and Melanie Brown returned as judges.\n\nThe competition was split into several stages: auditions, super bootcamp, home visits and live shows. Auditions in front of the show's producers took place throughout February and March 2012. The successful auditionees chosen by the producers were then invited back to the last set of auditions that took place in front of the judges and a live studio audience in May 2012. After the auditions was super bootcamp, where all four judges worked together and collectively chose 24 acts, including six from each of the four categories: Under 25 Boys, Under 25 Girls, Over 25s and Groups. Following super bootcamp was the home visits stage, where each of the judges reduced their six acts to three, with help from guest mentors Alicia Keys, Kesha, One Direction and Usher. The live shows began on 17 September 2012.",
