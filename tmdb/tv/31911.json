To restore what was lost, the brothers scour a war-torn land for the Philosopher's Sto­ne, a fabled relic which grants the ability to perform alchemy in impossible ways.\n\nThe Elrics are not alone in their search; the corrupt State Military is also eager to harness the artifact's power. So too are the strange Homunculi and their shadowy creator. The mythical gem lures exotic alchemists from distant kingdoms, scarring some deeply enough to inspire murder. As the Elrics find their course altered by these enemies and allies, their purpose remains unchanged – and their bond unbreakable.","popularity":59.74,"poster_path":"/5ZFUEOULaVml7pQuXxhpR2SmVUw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2849,"logo_path":"/cN3JNIKawjOMtfk0GBVIbsx69bg.png","name":"BONES","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":2883,"logo_path":"/rDYExnBV61jGQnkhVVrPN4Yl7O1.png","name":"Aniplex","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":10038,"logo_path":"/nCueXKwYIEXrZ5ofqSJBO1YcmRr.png","name":"SQUARE ENIX","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":3363,"logo_path":"/sj3vD7n63bTCih7bcf6GnWvRf1Q.png","name":"MBS","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":151984,"logo_path":null,"name":"Techno Sound","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2009-08-26","episode_count":20,"id":43387,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/iQZNlUAUHUGcf9diIePkzkVcCOz.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2009-04-04","episode_count":64,"id":43388,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/1cpXTzrUiMbqcCLsdxRfVIHJsEd.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":6.7}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.704,"vote_count":1710,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258a116760ee346616533c1","air_date":"2009-04-04","episodes":[{"air_date":"2009-04-05","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":761813,"name":"Fullmetal Alchemist","overview":"After escaping from Central Prison, the Freezing Alchemist, Isaac McDougal, sets his plan in motion to kill Führer King Bradley.
