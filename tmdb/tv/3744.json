Roaming the countryside, they encounter a man named Flint who runs a town of castaways from spaceship-wrecks.  Upon investigation, Flint turns out to be a renegade work robot (gamma series construction robot), who built the robotic shriekers in order to strand organics on the planet, so that he could order THEM around as revenge for his time spent in forced labor (...as a stock-boy...).  Team Lightyear shut down the subterranean shrieker construction plant that Flint had built, and defeat Flint, freeing the hapless castaways.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":3744,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525755ad760ee36aaa22a36e","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214729,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jan Strnad","original_name":"Jan Strnad","popularity":2.17,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525755ab760ee36aaa229ea1","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97180,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Steve Loter","original_name":"Steve Loter","popularity":1.752,"profile_path":"/5pwhyMiHLo4MNmIXxo7lM5KRaPo.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Flint (voice)","credit_id":"612350160f2fbd0030b97e3b","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Hamill","original_name":"Mark Hamill","popularity":19.658,"profile_path":"/2ZulC2Ccq1yv3pemusks6Zlfy2s.jpg"},{"character":"Gorgeous Woman (voice)","credit_id":"6123507a501cf2005eeff095","order":504,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":11084,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly McGillis","original_name":"Kelly McGillis","popularity":19.429,"profile_path":"/dozwem9ZtDgO4MMF8wzRDe6Wewn.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2000-11-17","episode_number":46,"episode_type":"standard","id":262834,"name":"Revenge of the Raenoks","overview":"When Booster is kidnapped by the Raenoks, in order to conduct a prisoner trade for Varg (XR is sent to guard Varg, who quickly escapes and takes XR to Raenok), Buzz & Mira fly off to save him w/ a newly developed cloaking device that can render 42 and/or its crew invisible.
