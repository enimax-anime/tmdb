is euphoric â€“ Jim Fenner (Jack Ellis) is dead! He was brutally killed in the hanging cell â€“ and his wife Di (Tracey Wilkinson) is the first to discover his bloody body.\n\nIt is not long before two earnest detectives are at the scene of the crime, DS Hook (Lucy Oâ€™Connell) and DI Hayes (Tony Slattery). They will leave no stone unturned until they find the murderer within the walls of this prison.\n\nSoon all the fingers are pointing to his wife Di Barker (Tracey Wilkinson), as it seems she has the most obvious motive and has been caught red handed with some damning evidence. But when all the inmates suddenly step forward and confess to being the murderer, the detectives become confused. Who did kill Jim Fenner?\n\nSheena (Laura Rogers) is due to be let out on an electronic tag â€“ but her freedom has lost some of its buzz now she has fallen for Pat Kerrigan (Liz May Brice). The attraction is mutual but Pat is scared of being hurt and pushing Sheena away.
