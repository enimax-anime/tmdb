Produced by and broadcast on ABC-TV, the series attained an instant cult status that persists to the present day.\n\nThe lead character, Aunty Jack was a unique comic creation — an obese, moustachioed, gravel-voiced transvestite, part trucker and part pantomime dame — who habitually solved any problem by knocking people unconscious or threatening to 'rip their bloody arms off'. Visually, she was unmistakable, dressed in a huge, tent-like blue velvet dress, football socks, workboots, and a golden boxing glove on her right hand. She rode everywhere on a Harley-Davidson motorcycle and referred to everyone as \"me little lovelies\" — when she was not uttering her familiar threat: \"I'll rip yer bloody arms off!\", a phrase which immediately passed into the vernacular. The character was devised and played by the multi-talented Grahame Bond and was partly inspired by his overbearing Uncle Jack, whom he had disliked as a child, his grandfather Ben Doyle and Dot Strong the ABC's last official tea lady.","popularity":1.463,"poster_path":"/6H2W1THw8J99hTlCGjIc3oAH6m5.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1972-11-16","episode_count":8,"id":23188,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1973-01-25","episode_count":6,"id":23189,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52581fb5760ee36aaa797822","air_date":"1972-11-16","episodes":[{"air_date":"1972-11-16","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":480121,"name":"Pilot","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":1,"show_id":12379,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":null,"episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":480123,"name":"Radio","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":1,"show_id":12379,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":null,"episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":480122,"name":"War","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":1,"show_id":12379,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":null,"episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":480124,"name":"Kulture","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":1,"show_id":12379,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":null,"episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":480125,"name":"Anonymous","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":1,"show_id":12379,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":null,"episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":480126,"name":"Family","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":1,"show_id":12379,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":null,"episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":480127,"name":"Sex","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":1,"show_id":12379,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1972-12-31","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"finale","id":480128,"name":"Horror","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":1,"show_id":12379,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":23188,"poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},"2":{"_id":"52581fb5760ee36aaa79782d","air_date":"1973-01-25","episodes":[{"air_date":"1973-01-25","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":480132,"name":"The Channel 970 Show","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":2,"show_id":12379,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":null,"episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":480131,"name":"The Iron Maiden Show","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":2,"show_id":12379,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1973-02-08","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":480133,"name":"The Golden Glove Show","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":2,"show_id":12379,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":null,"episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":480134,"name":"The Ear, Nose & Throat Show","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":2,"show_id":12379,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":null,"episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":480129,"name":"The Little Lovelies' Show","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":2,"show_id":12379,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1973-03-01","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"finale","id":480130,"name":"The R Certificate Show","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":2,"show_id":12379,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 2","overview":"","id":23189,"poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0}}}
