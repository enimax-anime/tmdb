The show is based on the 1980 motion picture of the same name. With a mixture of drama and music, it followed the lives of the students and faculty at the New York City High School for the Performing Arts. Although fictional, it was based heavily on the actual Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts in New York. Most interior scenes were filmed in Hollywood, California, and in all seasons but the third, several exterior scenes were shot on location in New York City.\n\nThe popularity of the series, particularly in the UK, led to several hit records and live concert tours by the cast. Despite its success, very few of the actors maintained high-profile careers after the series was cancelled. A number of the cast members were seen again briefly in Bring Back...Fame, a reunion special made for British television in 2008.","popularity":47.046,"poster_path":"/wed91CGCdmtBLbo82o0cF2QNRUw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2230,"logo_path":"/8UHPNZnCf2gfHs9DrSvJMa8t7Ry.png","name":"MGM Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":66065,"logo_path":null,"name":"Eilenna Productions Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1982-01-07","episode_count":16,"id":5090,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/9t38aXlFGxqfbuwyDMHwK6CwSOl.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1982-09-30","episode_count":23,"id":5089,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/bcom9bD24jCHqrQs95esyBi0sx7.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1983-10-15","episode_count":24,"id":5091,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1984-09-29","episode_count":25,"id":5092,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1985-10-12","episode_count":24,"id":5094,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1986-10-06","episode_count":24,"id":5093,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":6,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.612,"vote_count":49,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52571583760ee3776a133593","air_date":"1982-01-07","episodes":[{"air_date":"1982-01-07","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":108890,"name":"Metamorphosis","overview":"This fun and footloose series begins when Julie tries her best to fit in at the New York School for the Performing Arts, with a little bit of help from Doris and Montgomery.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":1798,"still_path":"/6T6nOSJ6GSsbPnw1Crw9a95HJHV.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"52571588760ee3776a133cbe","order":533,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":14319,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lycia Naff","original_name":"Lycia Naff","popularity":3.757,"profile_path":"/ssr49d7UTiyXmtoqLuo1Nht1Abh.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"52571588760ee3776a133ce4","order":581,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":77353,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jasmine Guy","original_name":"Jasmine Guy","popularity":6.431,"profile_path":"/dSuTS6DE7d8VEpHEoEFcNjNXtsW.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"52571588760ee3776a133d0a","order":627,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1213935,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Judy Farrell","original_name":"Judy Farrell","popularity":3.106,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":"1982-01-14","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":108893,"name":"Passing Grade","overview":"Coco and Lydia vie for a part in a show.
