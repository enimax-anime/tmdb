Once the house is moved to their lot, it's a race against time to get it renovated and ready for auction. Who will turn the biggest profit? Who will gamble it all and lose big? Who will destroy their house mid-move? And who will get their chops busted by their annoying rivals?",

The Slays think it will make a nice hunting cabin while Randy believes he can make money just selling the stone. The Snows think it is more work than it's worth. The bidding gets nasty between the Slays and Randy, but Cody and Suzi eventually win it. Before it can be moved, though, Cody will have to sweat it out and hack off the stone facade by hand. During the renovation, Cody and Suzi butt heads when she wants to add some of her special glam touches to the cabin and Cody wants to make it a manly space. Another house on Huron Trail in Lake Worth is a two bedroom 1960s era house in need of a significant renovation. Only half of the house is salvageable and all the electrical must be replaced. Since Randy can do that kind of work himself, he's much more interested in the house than either of the Snows or Slays. Randy gets the house at a relatively low price. When the Snow sisters heckle Randy about his design and decorating abilities, he hires designer Travis Lewis to help him out. There is tension between Randy and Travis when it is clear Randy wants to save every penny and not spend much on the design. Randy decides to surprise Travis with a unique decoration that he found.",

The Snow Sisters think it is adorable even though it is a 'T' shape, which means a more complicated moving process. They make no secret of their excitement about the house, as they feel Gary and Daddy can handle the move. Randy is lukewarm about it, but is interested only if the price is right. The Slays are divided: Suzi loves the house, but Cody is adamant that it would be too complicated to move. They eventually decide to pass. During the auction, it looks like Donna has it all but won when the high price forces Randy to drop out, but Suzi jumps in at the last second and the price continues to climb. Cody does everything he can to stop Suzi from bidding, and their argument leaves an opening for Donna Snow to jump in and win the auction. The Snows' plan is to cut the house in half and move it in two pieces, then decorate the house with a nod to the original style. In Weatherford, Texas, an attractive ranch is up for auction that appeals to all of the movers, but especially Randy. As the price climbs the Snows drop out, followed by the Slays. It finally gets too rich for Randy's blood and he drops out, leaving the win to an architectural salvage company owner. Randy ends up empty-handed and sour about losing the house to an outsider.",

The master suite resembles a hotel room with separate toilet and sink areas. Randy's plan is to update it throughout and create a master bath with a large walk-in closet all while giving a nod to the 70's style. When the Snows get outbid at another auction, they still have an ace up their sleeves. The Sisters decide to use a pool house that had come with another house they had won and to turn the 245 SF shell on a slab with no plumbing into a cute cottage complete with kitchen, bathroom, and living space. They finish it off with an adorable porch with natural cedar posts and railings.",

On the inside, he decides to go with a combination of retro design with modern functionality. Cody scores a large house, but has to knock it down when he can't get anyone to move it.
