Believing that the ship’s computer has turned against them, Sally has to shut down the system before it’s able to destroy the ship. Eventually, with the help of Ox and Wu Oof, she manages to pull the plug on Daphne, but before she can escape the core closes and the automatic destruct system is activated.\n\nWith only moments remaining, the crew leave the ship and molyport to Earth. They look to the skies waiting expectantly for the ship to explode beyond Earths atmosphere leaving them stranded in the 21st Century. When nothing happens the real saboteur reveals himself just before the crew realize that one of them has been left on board and that person must save the day. That individual is no other than the less then brilliant Reginald Montague Duck, janitor of the stars.",

The Dreadnaught Nemesis is the only ship capable of travelling through time in the A.C.A.T. fleet (Armed Chronological Advancement Taskforce).\n\nThe Nemesis follows a Reptid ship into the past. During the time-slip, a biological weapon is detonated, rendering the crew unconscious. When Captain Blowhard and her crew awake in the 21st century they quickly realize that something is different. Each crewmember must stand their post whilst trying in their own personal way to control and vent their newly acquired emotions.\n\nSally and Ox visit Earth looking for answers. Sally confuses the locals by her reaction to the local cuisine. Eventually, the crew turns to Doctor Striker for answers. With the future hanging in the balance and the fate of human kind in the doctor’s hands, do they really stand a chance?",
