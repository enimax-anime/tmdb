Over the course of three weeks, Steve Backshall discovers why the Bahamas provide such sanctuary for sharks, looking at the protection offered to them, people’s changing attitudes and the key role science plays in their conservation. Steve joins researchers who have dedicated their lives to this unique and often misunderstood group of animals and learns that a healthy shark population is absolutely vital to a healthy marine ecosystem.",
