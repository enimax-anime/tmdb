The series focuses on a trio made up of the alien princess Ilana, the rebellious soldier Lance, and the robot Octus; the three are able to combine to create the titular Sym-Bionic Titan. A preview of the series was first shown at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, and further details were revealed at Cartoon Network's 2010 Upfront. The series premiered on September 17, 2010, and ended on April 9, 2011. The series is rated TV-PG-V.\n\nCartoon Network initially ordered 20 episodes; Tartakovsky had hoped to expand on that, but the series was not renewed for another season, as the show \"did not have any toys connected to it.\" Although Sym-Bionic Titan has never been released on DVD, All 20 episodes are available on iTunes.\n\nOn October 7, 2012, reruns of Sym-Bionic Titan began airing on Adult Swim's Toonami block.","popularity":13.606,"poster_path":"/e1HgZg7ReDfS4UXDho7CTSRcGXr.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2010-09-17","episode_count":20,"id":43669,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/4DqRuZTOC5D4YlqWvSMZXILJ3f3.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.616,"vote_count":125,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258a308760ee3466166eb92","air_date":"2010-09-17","episodes":[{"air_date":"2010-09-17","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":765073,"name":"Escape to Sherman High","overview":"Three aliens (Lance, Ilana, and Octus) crash-land on Earth while fleeing the evil general that has conquered their home planet, Galaluna.

As they flee from the creature, Octus is hit by the creature in his leg, and cannot fix it. The gang then decide to contain the creature instead of destroying it.
