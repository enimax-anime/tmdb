The money was deducted, but they didn't pass it all on to her landlord - so the employee and her family were threatened with eviction. The sheriffs pay her former employers a visit - will they get her cash? The sheriffs also go to the home of a businessman who failed to pay an employee her wages. They are told he has moved out - but is it the truth? And the Sheriffs revisit a garage which sold a customer's car but didn't give him the money. They remove property to settle the debt, but a piece of equipment worth £20,000 is missing.",
