        "overview": "The Boss The Boss is back, and about to tour Australia. Sunday Night revisits Molly Meldrum’s chat with his good mate Bruce Springsteen. Bruce won’t let Molly forget the mammoth interview he’d given him years earlier describing it as the longest four hours of his life! Springsteen reveals the making of his incredible four-decade career as ‘The Boss’, and delivers some timely advice to today’s aspiring rock stars. Ping Pong Poms It’s the controversial story about the love/hate relationship between Aussies and Poms. Last year 56,000 Poms came to Australia to live, and more than 30,000 went home – desperate to leave ‘boring’ Australia behind. They complained the sun is too hot and the beach is too sandy. But the fact some become Australian citizens before they left, in case they changed their minds, sparked much debate. First Sounds Seeing 3-year-old Cooper’s joyful face when he heard sounds for the first time melted hearts around Australia. Now his parents reveal the real story about his diagnosis and what the future holds for the adorable toddler. Doctor John D’Arcy reveals how new cochlear technology is transforming lives young and old. It’s a fresh look at the feel-good story of 2012. Paradise Lost A new Sunday Night story on one of the most beautiful and remote places on earth. Pitcairn Island is situated halfway between New Zealand and South America and has a population of just 54. But although breathtakingly beautiful, the island hides a dark past. The key to its survival lies in luring those from the outside world to visit. Samsara 25 countries, five years, one extraordinary film. No actors, no dialogue, just the most breathtaking imagery you will ever see. Samsara is a snapshot of life around the globe. Cameras capture stunning pictures of temples scattered high on mountain tops, rituals of ancient civilisations, cities destroyed by flood, and fire burning deep below the earth’s surface. A new Sunday Night story that showcases our amazing planet.",
