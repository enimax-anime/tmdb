In the first team challenge of the season, Chef Ramsay asks the contestants to prepare their signature dish and splits the chefs into two teams: men vs. women.

Market, while the losing team is left behind to scrub down the kitchen in preparation for their first dinner service. Following a sobering announcement moments before the grand reopening of HELL'S KITCHEN, tempers flare when the teams struggle to communicate effectively and the slow service forces diners to walk out before their entrees are served.",

After hearing a few of the contestants' ideas, he introduces them to his guests, beer sommeliers Christina Perozzi and Hallie Beaune.\n\nThe competitors are told to prepare individual dishes using one or more types of beer. Chef Ramsay has designed the challenge to test the chefs' creativity and their ability to make a well-balanced and delicious dish using a unique element.\n\nKrupa's night of celebration is catching up with her, and she's not performing at her best. Since the women have six chefs to the men's five, they are told to drop one dish, and they choose Krupa's rabbit.",

He asks the two strongest players to name their weakest teammates. Jennifer does not hesitate to say Carrie, and Will immediately calls out Tommy.\n\nFor this challenge, Carrie and Will must lead their respective kitchens. They will start by creating a menu for their versions of five classic comfort foods: spaghetti and meatballs, pizza, burgers, Cobb salad, and chicken noodle soup.\n\nThe Red Team, especially the outspoken Elise, disagrees with Carrie's game plan, but at least she has one. Tommy can't pull it together, and the Blue Team waits for his guidance. Jonathan creates a pizza following Tommy's recipe but struggles to get his leader to focus. Still, both disorganized teams manage to finish the dishes before time runs out.",
