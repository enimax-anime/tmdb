Was it an engineering flaw or Mother Nature? Football fans want to know. Then, as 33 Chilean miners await their ultimate fate, trapped almost a half mile underground, mine drilling engineers scramble to dig a hole big enough to rescue them. Can a special drill make it though through earth harder than granite? And finally, JetBlue flight 194 started out like any other for 149 passengers.

Isn’t there anything that geotechnical engineers can do to protect property and lives? Also, next time you’re on a cruise vacation, it helps to know what could go wrong, based on a disastrous fire at sea on the Carnival Triumph. But can mega-ship engineering be fixed to avoid another cruise from hell? Finally, throughout the country, crucial infrastructure is falling apart.
