Hikaru, a 17 year old boy frustrated by his home life with his single mother and having been expelled from many high schools for bad behavior, enters Michi’s class as a new transfer student. As their relationship grows they realize that they both feel that they have lost themselves to the pressures of those around them, and it is this common bond that draws them dangerously close. What follows is a heart-wrenching story of forbidden love where Michi must face society’s judgement for corrupting a minor, abandoning her fiance, and disappointing her parents and co-workers.","popularity":7.196,"poster_path":"/9MOqlJROnRu713HF2OQfd5ZDoKk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1393,"logo_path":"/lUACMATs6jcscXIrzNCQzbvNVN5.png","name":"TBS","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1999-04-08","episode_count":11,"id":12011,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/3H9pzoXD90jkj4dUVVmfcMBCnXo.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":8,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52575b0019c29531db17f5e5","air_date":"1999-04-08","episodes":[{"air_date":"1999-04-08","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":282650,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":4054,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1999-04-15","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":282651,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":4054,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1999-04-22","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":282652,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":4054,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1999-04-29","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":282653,"name":"Episode 4","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":4054,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1999-05-06","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":282654,"name":"Episode 5","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":4054,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1999-05-13","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":282655,"name":"Episode 6","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":4054,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1999-05-20","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":282656,"name":"Episode 7","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":4054,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1999-05-27","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"standard","id":282657,"name":"Episode 8","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":4054,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1999-06-03","episode_number":9,"episode_type":"standard","id":282658,"name":"Episode 9","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":4054,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1999-06-10","episode_number":10,"episode_type":"standard","id":282659,"name":"Episode 10","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":4054,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1999-06-17","episode_number":11,"episode_type":"finale","id":282660,"name":"Episode 11","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":4054,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":12011,"poster_path":"/3H9pzoXD90jkj4dUVVmfcMBCnXo.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
