He moved here 33 years ago in search of a more \"truthful\" existence. In the years since, he's built a home, and survived by hunting, fishing and raising animals. Tom Oar lives with his wife on the Yaak River in Montana. He is 100 miles from the nearest town, a place he hasn't ventured to in 10 years. Marty Meierotto, his wife Dominique and their daughter Noah live in the small Alaskan town of Two Rivers. Every month, Marty pilots his bi-plane, traveling into the bush in search of the wolverine and lynx pelts he needs to make a living. While he's on the Black River, he must hunt moose and caribou to survive in the wilderness. Together, these men represent America's true MOUNTAIN MEN.",
