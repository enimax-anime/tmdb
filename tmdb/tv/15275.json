The series was produced in-house, under producer Susan Bower, in collaboration with writers Sarah Smith, John Ridley and Dave Warner, and directed by Kevin Carlin. It was filmed at Channel Nine’s GTV Studio 11 and on location in and around Melbourne. The series reportedly cost A$10 million to produce.\n\nThe 13-part series went to air from 16 April 2008. The series debuted to mixed critical reception and only average ratings, which were further eroded when the series was moved to a later timeslot. Nine removed Canal Road from its schedules after the seventh episode, which drew in only 360,000 viewers; however the eighth episode was still made available online. Nine aired the remaining episodes during August and December 2008.\n\nCanal Road was released on DVD on 4 August 2008 in Australia.","popularity":5.303,"poster_path":"/6Hkkb9nEiStv9FaxsDG2i42vsgo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40235,"logo_path":"/duPwb7Yi1zCVKiPAyN2QWpQFOpl.png","name":"Nine Network
