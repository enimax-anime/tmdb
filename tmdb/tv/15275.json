The series was produced in-house, under producer Susan Bower, in collaboration with writers Sarah Smith, John Ridley and Dave Warner, and directed by Kevin Carlin. It was filmed at Channel Nineâ€™s GTV Studio 11 and on location in and around Melbourne. The series reportedly cost A$10 million to produce.\n\nThe 13-part series went to air from 16 April 2008. The series debuted to mixed critical reception and only average ratings, which were further eroded when the series was moved to a later timeslot. Nine removed Canal Road from its schedules after the seventh episode, which drew in only 360,000 viewers; however the eighth episode was still made available online. Nine aired the remaining episodes during August and December 2008.\n\nCanal Road was released on DVD on 4 August 2008 in Australia.","popularity":5.303,"poster_path":"/6Hkkb9nEiStv9FaxsDG2i42vsgo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40235,"logo_path":"/duPwb7Yi1zCVKiPAyN2QWpQFOpl.png","name":"Nine Network
