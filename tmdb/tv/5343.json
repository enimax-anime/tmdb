The program is based on the Universal Press Syndicate syndicated comic strip You Can with Beakman and Jax created by Jok Church. The series premiered September 18, 1992 on The Learning Channel cable network and in national syndication.\n\nOn September 18, 1993 it moved from national syndication to CBS Saturday morning childrenâ€™s lineup. At the peak of its popularity, it was seen in nearly 90 countries around the world. The series was canceled in 1998. Reruns returned to national syndication in September 2006, after which it was transferred to local stations such as KICU. The show debuted a year prior to Bill Nye the Science Guy, which covered similar topics.

Although Lester suggests they are licked up by stray dogs, Beakman proceeds to explain the mysteries of rain and evaporation using a variety of household props. In the \"Beak-Mania\" portion of the show, Beakman attempts to answer, in rapid succession, short viewer inquiries on topics such as living prehistoric animals (the platypus), the most commonly used word in the English language and the heaviest animal in the history of the world (blue whale). Then, after a trick in which he balances a pair of forks atop a toothpick, Beakman forces Josie to reveal the question for the show's final segment, \"What is snot?\" Turning to volcanoes, Beakman explains the processes in the Earth's interior that create, and then discharge, molten magma. With the aid of film footage of volcanic eruptions, Beakman employs a foam rubber model of the Earth and a rubber glove to show how magma moves from deep inside the Earth and appears on the surface as lava. Finally, asked by Josie about why some volcanoes explode, Beakman uses a cherry pie to demonstrate the power, and mess, of a volcanic eruption.","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":5343,"still_path":"/d9KgFc7bSKiH8T93nikleRztwYg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1992-09-26","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":359283,"name":"Gravity, Beakmania & Inertia","overview":"Beakman explains the laws of gravity; Galileo shows the effects of gravity;.
