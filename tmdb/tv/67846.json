The owner's passion for coffee is almost a sickness and all he wants is for his customers to enjoy their coffee. He is a man of few words. If he has to say something, he gets his waiter Shinobu Gamo to speak on his behalf. Owner's real name is unknown. He would prefer to be addressed as the shops' \"Master\" rather than its owner - not that anyone is aware of this. He gives his all to coffee. Despite his wishes, his regular customers don't really come to taste the coffee. They are there because of love. They use his shop as a place for dates, marriage proposals and break-ups. He doesn't show it, but it saddens him that his customers are so preoccupied with affairs of the heart and not the coffee.","popularity":3.129,"poster_path":"/leoqkqBGn76M2dWLoI8U6BUV3VN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1393,"logo_path":"/lUACMATs6jcscXIrzNCQzbvNVN5.png","name":"TBS","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2003-10-09","episode_count":11,"id":80168,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/x34N2xQBBXj6eJVgZhsnn4LqBMT.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.333,"vote_count":3,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"57d809f39251412222005079","air_date":"2003-10-09","episodes":[{"air_date":"2003-10-09","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1223239,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":67846,"still_path":"/6dpa9hz3y8PQG83BRMrf5QlANFU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2003-10-16","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1223240,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":67846,"still_path":"/mQJISbfDEhHjRpvGQpLv2hB4lgQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2003-10-23","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1223241,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":67846,"still_path":"/9u4xYCDIR1DOBiSX2ge5dPGY8MT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2003-10-30","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":1223242,"name":"Episode 4","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":67846,"still_path":"/f5sDMYy2yt7pRH5ipmALYrYBaqb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2003-11-06","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":1223244,"name":"Episode 5","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":67846,"still_path":"/p5cIZNQzxnMxXYEL2lhC2kEkBdN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2003-11-13","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":1223245,"name":"Episode 6","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":67846,"still_path":"/eQaroazd51g4MqO4EwjKqDZW5wd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2003-11-20","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":1223246,"name":"Episode 7","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":67846,"still_path":"/926l7nIQatMlHt15rPyCEHJngFF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2003-11-27","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"standard","id":1223247,"name":"Episode 8","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":67846,"still_path":"/bGyJ4FE5J80Dj6197bxqWaAsF7H.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2003-12-04","episode_number":9,"episode_type":"standard","id":1223248,"name":"Episode 9","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":67846,"still_path":"/gVA1qE8XyRPmVw0ZwZV8yg7fxCj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2003-12-11","episode_number":10,"episode_type":"standard","id":1223249,"name":"Episode 10","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":67846,"still_path":"/pulJ13I94YUHhG9cPNefvbYeVEJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2003-12-18","episode_number":11,"episode_type":"finale","id":1223250,"name":"Episode 11","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":67846,"still_path":"/yx40XhKLZaxJZGoF1xWage8IDcA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":80168,"poster_path":"/x34N2xQBBXj6eJVgZhsnn4LqBMT.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
