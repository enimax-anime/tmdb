The Trojan War has been over for ten years, and the Greeks have come home victorious. Only one man is missing: the king of Ithaca, Odysseus, who is lost at sea. The island’s economy is getting worse by the day as the region’s many princes have invaded the kingdom, devouring its resources, and pressuring Queen Penelope to choose a new husband. To delay her suitors, she promises to choose once she’s finished weaving King Laertes’ burial shroud. But she undoes her work every night. Odysseus’ son Telemachus doesn’t dare lay claim to his father’s throne. His only dream is to sail out to rescue Odysseus.","popularity":6.75,"poster_path":"/zuRFs4DIYsCYv3YjyuaJ6qil6cZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":34570,"logo_path":"/eb9ANSGHNVJF6AJAgx9hyHJdXhC.png","name":"Making Prod","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1028,"logo_path":null,"name":"GMT Productions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":72453,"logo_path":null,"name":"Moviheart","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":72455,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunflag","origin_country":"PT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"PT","name":"Portugal"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2013-06-13","episode_count":12,"id":73231,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/zsjrstxolZNnYtAPDuQMWVoMFvu.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.8,"vote_count":2,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5686883e92514169d000ac25","air_date":"2013-06-13","episodes":[{"air_date":"2013-06-13","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1151882,"name":"The other side of the sea","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":64936,"still_path":"/ugGwCi27EpdWWzvYv93j4tlKiqT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-06-13","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1158413,"name":"The Duel","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":64936,"still_path":"/ugGwCi27EpdWWzvYv93j4tlKiqT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-06-13","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1160988,"name":"Ulysses is alive","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":64936,"still_path":"/ugGwCi27EpdWWzvYv93j4tlKiqT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-06-20","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":1160989,"name":"Should we kill Telemachus?","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":64936,"still_path":"/ugGwCi27EpdWWzvYv93j4tlKiqT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-06-20","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":1160990,"name":"Democracy against the barbarians","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":64936,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-06-20","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":1160991,"name":"The Return of Ulysses","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":64936,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-06-27","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":1160992,"name":"Peace and games","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":64936,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-06-27","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"standard","id":1160993,"name":"The Trojans girls","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":64936,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-07-04","episode_number":9,"episode_type":"standard","id":1160994,"name":"The Vengeance of Orion","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":64936,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-07-04","episode_number":10,"episode_type":"standard","id":1160995,"name":"The Marriage of Telemachus","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":64936,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-07-11","episode_number":11,"episode_type":"standard","id":1160996,"name":"Telemachus confronts Ulysses (1)","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":64936,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-07-11","episode_number":12,"episode_type":"finale","id":1160997,"name":"Telemachus confronts Ulysses (2)","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":64936,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":73231,"poster_path":"/zsjrstxolZNnYtAPDuQMWVoMFvu.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
