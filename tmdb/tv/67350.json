Even though sporty dad Gordon has been coaching Tilly, Jack is still convinced he can beat her. Because she is otherwise engaged, Tilly has been very organised and left video instructions for mum Tana to make a delicious post-race re-booster - a fruity smoothie bowl. But before they get to eat that, it is a nerve-wracking time for the Ramsay bunch as they wait to see if Jack and Tilly can complete the toughest challenge they have ever taken on and make it safely back to dry land. To cap off an incredible day, Tilly cooks a celebratory brunch of champions - delicious American waffles with letter eggs and oven-baked chicken.",
