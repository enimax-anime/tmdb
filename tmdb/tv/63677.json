With big, silly characters and hilarious stories, Top Coppers is filled with familiar tropes and references from the police and action genres, as well as drawing on relatable British situations, problems and relationships.","popularity":2.074,"poster_path":"/q4GAksFkFL7S7Q41rdZ2D22jjtJ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2015-08-19","episode_count":6,"id":69702,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.3,"vote_count":3,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"55d36c4d9251412013000294","air_date":"2015-08-19","episodes":[{"air_date":"2015-08-19","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1099193,"name":"The Chill of the Cockney Freezer","overview":"Notorious Cockney crime boss Harry McCrane takes over an ice cream factory.
