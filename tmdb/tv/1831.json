From houses made made of straw bales and built in 6 days, to one embedded into its wooded landscape and another integrated with a landmark water tower, the projects have been unique, incredibly ambitious and ultimately inspirational. But have they stood the test of time? And did they fulfil the promises and dreams their owners had strived so relentlessly for? By request, this DVD revisits 8 projects, some ten years on, to answer those key questions.",

They bought a run down medieval thatched cottage and lovingly brought it back to life. Then just before Christmas, with Cheryl pregnant, disaster struck. A fault in the chimney caused a massive fire which destroyed the entire building. Overnight Alex and Cheryl had lost almost £400,000.\n\nWhilst most people would have walked away from this, Alex and Cheryl couldn’t let go of their dream. Nine months after the fire, they decided to start all over again and rebuild the cottage, bigger and better than before.",

It's a squarish, modular building, with glass walls from floor to ceiling. The outside of the building is clad in cedar that will go grey to match the surrounding oak trees.\n\nThe idea is that by prefabricating most of the house it should be quicker and easier to put together on site. But although it will be precision made, it isn’t a kit house.",

Years later he bought it, with the idea of turning it into a spectacular, theatrical mock 16th century home, complete with grand baronial hall, luxury bedrooms, sweeping staircases, water spouting gargoyles, Jacuzzis in the battlements and a huge recording studio in the basement. \n\nBut would it prove to be a magnificent personal masterpiece, or a garish sub-Disneyesque disaster?\n\nAfter borrowing an eye-watering 1.2 million Euros, Sean launches into his project just as Ireland plunges into recession. He has a head full of fairy tales, but no help from an architect, or indeed any formal plans whatsoever. Making things up as you go along is fine if you're building a toy castle, but not when you've got a large team of builders on site, a schedule to hit and the bank looking over your shoulder.\n\nOver two years, rooms are built, then knocked down again. Contractors walk out in frustration. Planning permissions are ignored.\n\nBut somehow Sean's vision starts to come alive... just as Ireland collapses into financial meltdown.",

The results are hair raising as the cranes and steel frames hit the narrow plot.\n\nBut Carl's biggest test lies ahead, when it comes to finishing the minimalist interior.

To make matters worse, the neighbours aren't happy about such a radical sight in their traditional community.

Until they fell in love with Christmas Farm, near Newbury, and took the life changing decision to quit their urban media jobs and move to the country.\n\nThey faced two big problems however: first there was an agricultural tie on the land, so Phil and Michael would have to become farmers; the second problem was the uninspiring faux-alpine timber chalet serving as a farmhouse - it had to go.\n\nBut Phil and Michael have decided they don't want to build a regular brick farmhouse as a replacement. Determined to bring a bit of urban glamour to their new home, they want a 21st-century farmhouse unlike anything the area has seen before.\n\nPhil and Michael's version cleverly combines a vast, white, dramatic open-plan party pad upstairs, with muddy functional farming spaces below.\n\nAs the builders go to work on the extraordinary hand-crafted flint exterior, complete with the largest sliding trapezoid window in Britain, Phil and Michael must juggle construction with farming the land.\n\nAnd in order to make it all work financially they decide to set up a new micro-brewery in the barn.",

Rejecting the coastal sprawl around Malaga they found a virgin plot of land up in the Andalucian hills for just £35,000.\n\nBut instead of building a home like the traditional old fincas nearby, their architect son's design was a confrontational, modernist glass box, surrounded by boldly coloured connected rooms, hidden behind a giant citadel wall.\n\nConstruction proved stressful. The couple put all their trust in a local Spanish builder who had never built a house like this before. The local residents didn't like it and the mayor tried to get it re-painted white. But if they could just finish the build, it promised to be the coolest retirement home Kevin McCloud has ever seen.\n\nSadly, Gil died a few years ago, but now Kevin returns to meet with Hillary again and to see whether or not their building has settled into its landscape, whether it's still multi-coloured, and to find out just how life is for her as a British widow living up in the Andalucian hills.",

Ben hoped a home standing on stilts above a marsh, and incorporating ship-like qualities such as a keel-shaped roof, will be enough to satisfy his boat-mad uncle. However, Ben's contractor goes into liquidation a few months into the project, taking pounds 87,000 of the pounds 300,000 budget, and when James decides to make a few tweaks to the design, alarm-bells begin to ring for the young architect.",
