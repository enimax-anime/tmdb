Andrew feels passionately that the SFC brand in the UK is in need of an overhaul, and feels himself at odds with the carefully constructed image he has spent years developing for the brand in 70 countries overseas. In the UK, SFC is associated with post-pub late night binge eats rather than seen as a family restaurant. Andrew spends time behind the counter to find out why the company's 200 UK franchises aren't living up to his expectations. Can he get his business back on track? Strong language",
