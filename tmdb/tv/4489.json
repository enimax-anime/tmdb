Produced for Saturday morning television by Hanna-Barbera Productions, sixteen episodes of Josie and the Pussycats aired on CBS during the 1970-71 television season, and were rerun during the 1971-72 season. In 1972, the show was re-conceptualized as Josie and the Pussycats in Outer Space, sixteen episodes of which aired on CBS during the 1972-73 season and were rerun the following season. Reruns of the original series alternated between CBS, ABC, and NBC from 1974 through 1976. This brought its national Saturday morning TV run on three networks to six years.\n\nJosie and the Pussycats featured an all-girl pop music band that toured the world with their entourage, getting mixed up in strange adventures, spy capers, and mysteries. On the small-screen, the group consisted of level-headed lead singer and guitarist Josie, intelligent tambourinist Valerie, and air-headed blonde drummer Melody. Other characters included their cowardly manager Alexander Cabot III, his conniving sister Alexandra, her cat Sebastian, and muscular roadie Alan.","popularity":7.862,"poster_path":"/y5CjUqhmxHqulHBZ37hwPXBCoCP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1353,"logo_path":"/yXhCcOFK5Fy3ZBQwhBYx8Zu9ZIw.png","name":"Hanna-Barbera Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":13453,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1970-09-12","episode_count":16,"id":13452,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/slCHSahSKghGK9FxIsfTcPQcHzv.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.136,"vote_count":44,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52576be9760ee36aaa3fac38","air_date":"1970-09-12","episodes":[{"air_date":"1970-09-12","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":313884,"name":"The Nemo's a No No Affair","overview":"On their way to Pago Pago for a musical stint, Josie and her companions find themselves in troubled waters when the ship on which they are sailing is torpedoed by Captain Nemo.","production_code":"","runtime":21,"season_number":1,"show_id":4489,"still_path":"/vZ9tWhbsigMxaneiVAW9reHkKSN.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1970-09-19","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":313889,"name":"A Green Thumb Is Not a Goldfinger","overview":"Over the Amazon, the companions become part of a cargo drop on Dr. Greenthumb's supply zone.
