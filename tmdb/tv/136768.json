Now, in an all-new series, Forrest, along with his wife and zoologist, Jessica Summerfield, travel across the globe from Mozambique to the Pacific Northwest, to investigate reports of 'strange sightings,' 'legendary creatures' and 'mysterious encounters' between humans and wildlife that may not only lead to conflict but may further lead to that animal extinction behind the local lore. Forrest's goal is to end the conflict and to solve the riddles behind the local legends and mysteries before these animals truly become 'mythological' due to extinction.",
