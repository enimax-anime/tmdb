In their first adventure, they go to an island to rescue Dr. Marbles. In subsequent adventures, they return to Cyberspace to thwart Hacker's evil plans, ranging from ruining Motherboard to trying to take over a Cybersite. Throughout the season, the Cybersquad searched for a new encryptor chip for Motherboard. In Episode 9, Buzz and Delete nearly retrieved the encryptor chip, but lost it in a dust storm, much to Hacker's frustration.",

In their first adventure, they go to an island to rescue Dr. Marbles. In subsequent adventures, they return to Cyberspace to thwart Hacker's evil plans, ranging from ruining Motherboard to trying to take over a Cybersite. Throughout the season, the Cybersquad searched for a new encryptor chip for Motherboard. In Episode 9, Buzz and Delete nearly retrieved the encryptor chip, but lost it in a dust storm, much to Hacker's frustration.",

In searching for the button, Buzz and Delete capture Ollie's mom Abby, and accidentally drill into the inner slime core. Hacker locks Doctor Marbles and Abby away while he recalculates the location of the button. Motherboard sends the Cybersquad into Ecotopia to investigate where the slime came from, and what they can do to help. They soon realize that many of the animals of the Cybersite have lost their homes due to the slime destroying 2/3rds of the Preserve. In order to fix this, they must install a new preserve and format it in a way that the animals can live comfortably, plus they need to relocate the animals. Using an ark they are able to bring the animals to the new preserve, but by just narrowly escaping a whirlpool. Soon after, the Cybersquad and Ollie notice that the orangutans are in the wrong portion of the preserve. In order to figure out why, Inez and Ollie return to the old preserve and examine the wildlife. But in order to do so, Inez must overcome her fear of bats, and Ollie must overcome his fear of heights. If that wasn't enough, they overhear Hacker looking for the button and realize he has caused the inner slime core to erupt. Ollie spots his mother with Hacker, so he desperately wants to save her. The Cybersquad and Ollie formulate a plan that succeeds in rescuing Dr. Marbles and Abby, while installing a lock on the Reformat Button, thus ejecting Hacker into Cyberspace. The movie finishes with Inez and Ollie enjoying a sandwich high up in a tree.\n\nCybersites: Ecotopia, Control Central, and unknown frozen Cybersite.",
