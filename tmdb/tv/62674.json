In each episode, Lemonis makes an offer that’s impossible to refuse; his cash for a piece of the business and a percentage of the profits. And once inside these companies, he’ll do almost anything to save the business and make himself a profit; even if it means firing the president, promoting the secretary or doing the work himself.","popularity":13.133,"poster_path":"/nY1KcjVzx03az2eYu9h7WFE8WTs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2013-07-30","episode_count":6,"id":77852,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/yzmF5xOPupuTYlUsZPZRYONRIIe.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":8},{"air_date":"2014-02-25","episode_count":18,"id":77853,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/x9M5pmky8ME37wTSnXyn4W1suuU.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2015-05-13","episode_count":22,"id":66705,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/oNKU2eOiLspA6zzHK0Q1Lvj5vfG.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2016-08-23","episode_count":20,"id":79376,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/6pbPjCqLJ3nXFjAauJJjnTiPly3.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2017-11-21","episode_count":18,"id":82100,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/2eyiceR8gimUNWunXYxPPyuOalg.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2018-12-04","episode_count":11,"id":113962,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":"/6CbCzptUw00HhcSb8WYxhky5Znp.jpg","season_number":6,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2019-11-05","episode_count":12,"id":135027,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":"/8qNzDTJNNDHLR3tzGYbqQn1uUki.jpg","season_number":7,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2021-08-10","episode_count":8,"id":205622,"name":"Season 8","overview":"","poster_path":"/ayUR8YllF3HK8XVP5QX8vXv465Z.jpg","season_number":8,"vote_average":7.4}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Reality","vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":25,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"57658ce79251413153000708","air_date":"2013-07-30","episodes":[{"air_date":"2013-07-30","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1200294,"name":"Car Cash","overview":"Marcus helps two feuding brothers who buy used cars for cash.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":62674,"still_path":"/7wQWamFMtFoXSER05dFEWQYlB0R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-08-06","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1200295,"name":"Maarse Florist","overview":"Maarse Florists was once thriving but lost its way after the founder's death.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":62674,"still_path":"/zuLP76Lrkzr6FFw6C8zskqSog2M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-08-13","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1200296,"name":"Planet Popcorn","overview":"Despite generating millions in sales, Planet Popcorn still can’t show a profit.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":62674,"still_path":"/yO0VS0sifYtXpFDppohRTs9By2W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-08-20","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":1200297,"name":"Eco-Me","overview":"Eco-Me's worthy products are undermined by bad business practices and debt.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":62674,"still_path":"/anTUCztHKSF8KWUb001KzyqxY9a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-08-27","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":1200298,"name":"LA Dogworks","overview":"LA Dogworks is a state-of-the-art dog care facility with a volatile leadership.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":62674,"still_path":"/uzv0oe6L9qBMd22dRstjW5cfshj.jpg","vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-09-03","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"finale","id":1200299,"name":"Mr. Green Tea","overview":"Marcus Lemonis attempts to help Mr. Green Tea, a family-run ice cream company.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":62674,"still_path":"/cjdq3VshOAKIvZCASlze55z5waH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":77852,"poster_path":"/yzmF5xOPupuTYlUsZPZRYONRIIe.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":8},"2":{"_id":"57658d16c3a36812cb00088e","air_date":"2014-02-25","episodes":[{"air_date":"2014-02-25","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1214326,"name":"Athans Motors","overview":"Pete Athans sank his life savings into building a high-end used car dealership.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":2,"show_id":62674,"still_path":"/tOz1ksMCIG22TzHANhFdcSOgfH3.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-03-04","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1214327,"name":"A.
