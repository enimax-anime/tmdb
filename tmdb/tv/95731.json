Over in the Affection Section at Rafiki’s Planet Watch, it’s make or break for a much smaller resident, Popcorn, a rescued chicken with an egg problem who requires surgery.

Over at The Seas with Nemo & Friends at EPCOT, aquarist Amanda, who’s expecting her first child, prepares to welcome another little ray of sunshine into the world: a spotted eagle ray pup.
