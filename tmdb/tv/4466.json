The first portion aired from August 13, 2007, until December 10, 2007, while the second portion aired from March 24, 2008, until May 12, 2008. It was primarily filmed in Los Angeles, California, with additional footage in Crested Butte, Colorado; Las Vegas, Nevada; and Paris, France. The executive producer was Liz Gateley.\n\nThe Hills focuses on the lives of Lauren Conrad, Audrina Patridge, Whitney Port, and Heidi Montag. During the season, Conrad ended her friendship with Montag after suspecting that she and her boyfriend Spencer Pratt fabricated rumors of a sex tape involving herself and ex-boyfriend Jason Wahler. The ensuing feud between the three became a central focus of the series, and was carried through each subsequent season. Meanwhile, Patridge resumed a relationship with her on-again/off-again boyfriend Justin Brescia.","id":13372,"poster_path":"/fBpVj48zGj3Zgx7YOjuZeQ7tSG0.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},"4":{"_id":"52576a79760ee36aaa3d5c48","air_date":"2008-08-18","episodes":[{"air_date":"2008-08-18","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":311295,"name":"We'll Never Be Friends","overview":"The tension between Lo, Lauren and Audrina continues and soon things reach boiling point.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":4,"show_id":4466,"still_path":"/3N7NenSwlvHmgZFliR5JFiYawnX.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Self","credit_id":"571225e79251410a68002a39","order":0,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1224510,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lauren Conrad","original_name":"Lauren Conrad","popularity":1.576,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"571225fc92514166fa002b9f","order":1,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":81015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Audrina Patridge","original_name":"Audrina Patridge","popularity":3.797,"profile_path":"/t5GmlgEboANVOApbHMVA0tEfnjB.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"571226269251413031000283","order":2,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1223711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Heidi Montag","original_name":"Heidi Montag","popularity":4.763,"profile_path":"/5FOGy8jsiCh8YVddkRhWrN96OYb.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"57122cf5c3a36831e1006ef5","order":3,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1223710,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Spencer Pratt","original_name":"Spencer Pratt","popularity":1.96,"profile_path":"/715SLrfUT08Fp0SqBF3ZnxxiH2J.jpg"},{"character":"Himself","credit_id":"52576a88760ee36aaa3d6335","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236854,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Doug Reinhardt","original_name":"Doug Reinhardt","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/sgvn2qCmJkjoTG2cq6Inj7fAHR.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5712260ec3a3686636002bcd","order":503,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1224518,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Whitney Port","original_name":"Whitney Port","popularity":1.736,"profile_path":"/qIAyk9cwoSM4k60iIh6QyoGoNp6.jpg"},{"character":"Himself","credit_id":"57122ef59251410aab002cbb","order":511,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236855,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brody Jenner","original_name":"Brody Jenner","popularity":1.869,"profile_path":"/fi3oSAIamnoj9fQMZXBfIu15HVU.jpg"},{"character":"Herself","credit_id":"5713730bc3a368537000dea0","order":517,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1234358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lo Bosworth","original_name":"Lo Bosworth","popularity":1.96,"profile_path":"/8ij8ZbQjpQYdL98yF5yqq40rV4k.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"571376d992514151cf0017fd","order":520,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1607015,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Justin Brescia","original_name":"Justin Brescia","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/21YbMBVyRGWjxngKYqEzEcLJs7v.jpg"},{"character":"Herself","credit_id":"57137ad892514152030017b3","order":523,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1236852,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Holly Montag","original_name":"Holly Montag","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":"/tG21XJAMDxHLJ7Tg5NNucBxz0T5.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2008-08-25","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":311296,"name":"Drama Follows Them","overview":"Stephanie's birthday party is around the corner and so everyone tries to make an appearance.

It aired from August 18, 2008, until December 22, 2008. The season was filmed primarily in Los Angeles, California, with additional footage in New York City, New York; Las Vegas, Nevada; Italy; and Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. The executive producer was Liz Gateley.\n\nThe Hills focuses on the lives of Lauren Conrad, Audrina Patridge, Whitney Port, and Heidi Montag. During the season, Conrad's distaste for Montag's boyfriend Spencer Pratt continues to inhibit reconciliation between the women. Meanwhile, Patridge is concerned that her new housemate Lo Bosworth is straining her relationship with Conrad. The season finale saw Port relocate to New York City to accept employment with Diane von FÃ¼rstenberg, while Montag and Pratt elope.\n\nUpon the conclusion of the season, Port was commissioned her own spin-off series The City, which originally chronicled the lives of her and friends Olivia Palermo, Jay Lyon, Erin Lucas, and Adam Senn. Additionally, rumors were widespread that Conrad wished to leave the series to pursue other career opportunities, though she made her final appearance on the series during the mid-season finale of the following season.","id":13371,"poster_path":"/4FOoVIGImBVQa0p7o1j9gBPlKjQ.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},"5":{"_id":"52576a79760ee36aaa3d5c0a","air_date":"2009-04-06","episodes":[{"air_date":"2009-04-06","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":311241,"name":"Don't Cry on Your Birthday","overview":"Lauren lands in tears during her surprise birthday party when Heidi rocks the boat by showing up uninvited.
