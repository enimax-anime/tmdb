Over the years the powerful nobles have tried and failed to usurp power from Jiso, causing her to grow wary and later even reluctant to hand the throne over. As her son comes of age, she creates the Hwarang, an elite group of male youth who train in fighting and education. Their existence cuts across the existing power factions and Sam Maekjong is amidst their ranks under the false name Kim Ji-Dwi, unbeknownst to other Hwarang members.","popularity":109.825,"poster_path":"/sXEiMRfG2IiSpa7gVWY401L6n21.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":86763,"logo_path":null,"name":"Hwarang SPC","origin_country":""},{"id":86764,"logo_path":null,"name":"Oh!Boy Project","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2016-12-19","episode_count":20,"id":77059,"name":"Season 1","overview":"An elite group of young warriors trained in morals and martial arts finds love and friendship in Silla during Korea’s ancient Three Kingdoms period.","poster_path":"/yVH3RcMZOKxdHXoQn3LrRtQwClm.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":10}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.1,"vote_count":219,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"57387f70c3a3684d4900032c","air_date":"2016-12-19","episodes":[{"air_date":"2016-12-19","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1193449,"name":"To the Capital","overview":"In Silla about 1,500 years ago, Queen Jiso reluctantly receives an unexpected visitor and two friends go to the capital in search of family.","production_code":"","runtime":58,"season_number":1,"show_id":66496,"still_path":"/mPDfr0wtq91U9YTJ5FGaZ55udyu.jpg","vote_average":10,"vote_count":2,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Mak-Moon","credit_id":"5a8aafbb9251410a1f072f6e","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Kwang-soo","original_name":"Lee Kwang-soo","popularity":11.711,"profile_path":"/eStCnnm18x5MogLGQAqHUmXOTCF.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2016-12-20","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1245405,"name":"Mak Moon's Death","overview":"Dog-Bird receives bad news and Wehwa agrees to form the hwarang as part of Jiso’s grand plan to help ensure Silla’s future.","production_code":"","runtime":58,"season_number":1,"show_id":66496,"still_path":"/nYSpMKLL7v91JC4ZcJWWdtyLE2A.jpg","vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Mak-Moon","credit_id":"5a8aafbb9251410a1f072f6e","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1326172,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lee Kwang-soo","original_name":"Lee Kwang-soo","popularity":11.711,"profile_path":"/eStCnnm18x5MogLGQAqHUmXOTCF.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2016-12-26","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1245406,"name":"Your Brother","overview":"Wehwa reviews hwarang candidates.
