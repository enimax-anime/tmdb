It and sister series Canada's Worst Handyman are the two highest-rated programs on Discovery Channel. The series is produced by Proper Television, whose president, Guy O'Sullivan, was the director for the original Britain's Worst Driver series; as such, Canada's Worst Driver is considered to be the production company's flagship show.\n\nUnlike other Worst series around the world, the Canadian version emphasizes the learning process of the contestants and the science of driving, and as such is often more serious than the other Worst shows around the world, which are mainly played for laughs. It is the longest running of any Worst series to date.\n\nThe series is also aired dubbed in French in Canada, as the Les z√©ros de conduite on Canal D.","popularity":5.79,"poster_path":"/xWk9KojwlrfPEi67hU3iNJdUZVA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2012-10-28","episode_count":2,"id":45372,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2005-10-02","episode_count":8,"id":45370,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/nFKaAFW9Dz489AtjZWas4aCaNpt.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2006-10-16","episode_count":8,"id":45366,"name":"Season 2","overview":"Canada's Worst Driver 2 is the second season of Canada's Worst Driver, a Discovery Channel Canada television series which seeks to improve the driving skills of eight selected contestants, who are also trying to avoid being named the show's eponymous and dubious title.

Like previous series, each contestant is nominated by a loved one, and are taken to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre, located this year at an abandoned correctional facility in Guelph, Ontario. At the rehabilitation centre, each contestant is taught key driving skills, and are tested in various challenges, with three challenges to an episode. Before each challenge, host Andrew Younghusband performs each challenge to demonstrate that they are doable without error by an average driver. The first episode, where the contestants must drive to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre from a location an hour's drive away in the traditional first challenge, serves as a skills evaluation. Starting with the second episode, and at the end of every episode thereafter, the experts and Andrew decide on which of the remaining contestants have been sufficiently rehabilitated to be let go onto public roads. This continues until three contestants remain, where two traditional final challenges determine who is named Canada's Worst Driver. Though normally one contestant leaves in every episode, the experts may, at their discretion, refuse to allow anyone to graduate, or conversely graduate more than one contestant in an episode. In extreme circumstances, the experts may also choose to expel a contestant with no intention of improving their driving skills. This year, like the previous season, roughly half of the challenges are new to the series, while the other half, such as the initial drive to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre, the Eye of the Needle, the Water-Tank Challenge, the Mega-Challenge, and the series-ending road test, are returning from previous seasons. However, the challenges this season are more specifically tuned for the individual contestants than in previous years, to better address driving issues specific to each contestant. For this year, a fleet of brand-new luxury cars have been commissioned for some of the challenges.","poster_path":"/wClrcCMJPZHIlsLXVEMKGMJAHq4.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2009-10-26","episode_count":8,"id":45367,"name":"Season 5","overview":"Canada's Worst Driver 5 is the fifth season of Canada's Worst Driver, the Canadian automotive television series on Discovery Channel which seeks to improve the skills of eight of the worst motorists in Canada.\n\nIn this season, the eight contestants are taken to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre in CFB Borden, which had been previously used in Canada's Worst Driver 2.

Like previous series, each contestant is nominated by a loved one, and are taken to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre, located this year at an abandoned correctional facility in Guelph, Ontario. At the rehabilitation centre, each contestant is taught key driving skills, and are tested in various challenges, with three challenges to an episode. Before each challenge, host Andrew Younghusband performs each challenge to demonstrate that they are doable without error by an average driver. The first episode, where the contestants must drive to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre from a location an hour's drive away in the traditional first challenge, serves as a skills evaluation. Starting with the second episode, and at the end of every episode thereafter, the experts and Andrew decide on which of the remaining contestants have been sufficiently rehabilitated to be let go onto public roads. This continues until three contestants remain, where two traditional final challenges determine who is named Canada's Worst Driver. Though normally one contestant leaves in every episode, the experts may, at their discretion, refuse to allow anyone to graduate, or conversely graduate more than one contestant in an episode. In extreme circumstances, the experts may also choose to expel a contestant with no intention of improving their driving skills. This year, like the previous season, roughly half of the challenges are new to the series, while the other half, such as the initial drive to the Driver Rehabilitation Centre, the Eye of the Needle, the Water-Tank Challenge, the Mega-Challenge, and the series-ending road test, are returning from previous seasons. However, the challenges this season are more specifically tuned for the individual contestants than in previous years, to better address driving issues specific to each contestant. For this year, a fleet of brand-new luxury cars have been commissioned for some of the challenges.","id":45365,"poster_path":"/wClrcCMJPZHIlsLXVEMKGMJAHq4.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},"5":{"_id":"5258d96a760ee3466172843a","air_date":"2009-10-26","episodes":[{"air_date":"2009-10-26","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":789240,"name":"Basic Training","overview":"Eight of the country's most appalling drivers and their nominators begin the rehabilitation process by first driving to The Rehab Centre, situated at an undisclosed Ontario military location.\n\nThis year's drivers begin their Basic Training with some skills evaluation.
