Sam Jay opens up about her growth as a comedian, stand-up stories while coming up in Boston and always being present. Brent discusses starting as a rapper before singing, his writing approach and being a music executive. O’Malley talks about how he first got into fighting, his preparation as a professional and how that approach informs his lifestyle. Wiz breaks down how he brings people together through music, why he first got into sparring and the benefits of martial arts. Steve-O reminisces on the Jackass era, craving attention and how he’s evolved over the years. Sloane shares tennis stories, from her longest match to how she breaks down her opponents, and talks about taking her mom to a UFC event.",
