She's got the passion, initiative, and drive, but due to her lack of writing skills, she still remains an assistant writer. When she was young, the radio was the only thing in the world that she could share with her blind mother. She was consoled by the sounds of the radio and loved it more than anything, so she became a writer. When her radio program is on the verge of cancellation, she succeeds in casting a top actor Ji Suho, who can't do anything without a script.","popularity":12.542,"poster_path":"/xpiV46aAnD4U5r7IUZYh4NtkcvU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":147395,"logo_path":"/kAEJFoXRVb6HfC9AxZ9NVbgWEDH.png","name":"Arc Media","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2018-01-29","episode_count":16,"id":97429,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/mITaFJnMKcG8onCLpzvD5BjvNip.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.1,"vote_count":16,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5a4dffa292514173550084b6","air_date":"2018-01-29","episodes":[{"air_date":"2018-01-29","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1414936,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"When the star of her radio show runs off, Song Geu-rim loses her job.
