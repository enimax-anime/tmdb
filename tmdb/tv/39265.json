Val Milnes became pregnant at 18, and knowing that her strict father would never allow her to keep the child, she made the heartbreaking decision to give him up for adoption. She watched as he was taken away by his new parents with the case of clothes she had carefully prepared. Seventeen years later, Val suffered an accident which left her paralysed and tried to establish contact with her son, sending him a series of letters. The fact that these letters went unanswered has haunted her ever since. In the second of tonight's stories, Donna Leaver told her father Pat in a telephone call that she did not want him in her life any more when she was 6 years old. Taking her word for it, Pat disappeared and made no further attempt to contact her.",

It’s a search that takes us from Colonial Kenya in the 1950s to the heart of the World War I battlefields in Northern France.\n\n \n\nSixty six year old Inge Dart grew up in Kenya in the dying days of the British Empire.

At the age of nineteen, when Inge became pregnant with her childhood sweetheart Jeremy, her mother intervened and sent Inge half way around the world to have her baby in secret.\n\n \n\nBanished to Surrey, Inge was taken in by a couple who looked after her until her daughter was born. In the ten days that followed, she cared for her baby, knowing time was running out. The only joyous moments were when Jeremy visited and the young couple were able to enjoy what little time they had with their daughter.\n\n \n\nThe loss of her baby has haunted Inge ever since and she now craves the peace she knows will only come when she sees her daughter once more.\n\n \n\nWatch what happens when we take on Inge’s search and, in a first for Long Lost Family, take on her daughter’s search for her father Jeremy.",
