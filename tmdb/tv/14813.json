It was produced by the Nine Network in conjunction with Paramount Pictures.\n\nThe series centres on the action and adventures of lead actor Jack Thompson's character Erskine, and his main support character, Peter Sumner's Gunthar Haber. It was the first lead role for Jack Thompson. The two are part of an elite unit of special operatives, the Special Intelligence Unit, and their adventures are loosely based upon those of the real Services Reconnaissance Department who often operated behind Japanese-held lines during the war. Unlike most previous war films, Spyforce deliberately steered away from the notion that the United States was solely responsible for Japan's defeat, and highlights the important role Australian forces played in the defeat of the Imperial Japanese Army. Producer Roger Mirams was also careful to avoid stereotypes of the genre, and tired formulas for the battle scenes.\n\nThe idea appealed to American producers Paramount Pictures, who backed creator Roger Mirams to begin production without having seen a script. He made the pilot episode, \"Spy Catcher\", which impressed Paramount, and the Nine Network immediately bought the local rights. The first episode aired in Sydney on 8 August 1971, and the rest of Australia on 26 August 1971. It was originally intended to produce 26 episodes, but following the success of the first series, Mirams held talks with both Nine Network and Paramount Pictures, who backed him for a second series. In all 42 episodes were produced. The series was last aired on Australian television in Adelaide on 21 September 1976, but has been re-run several times since.","popularity":3.212,"poster_path":"/fLgoft3qbL3Va02xT81Z3Gm3Sla.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1971-08-02","episode_count":42,"id":26369,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525835f2760ee36aaa93a2dd","air_date":"1971-08-02","episodes":[{"air_date":"1971-08-02","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":529566,"name":"The General","overview":"The Japanese army have invaded New Ireland and plantation owners,  Erskine and Haber have fled to Australia leaving behind a woman they both love.
