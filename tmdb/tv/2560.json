She can't remember quite everything, but the old boyfriend is back, resuscitated by the aliens, and he drugs her so she tells him where the missing part of a device is. He activates what turns out to be a thermo-chemical bomb that will wipe England off the map when the four chemicals meet in a central chamber.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"1973-03-15","episode_number":26,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":2560,"still_path":"/xtdhCGobSe0ftuWksjKfinoK36j.jpg"},"name":"UFO","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":117,"logo_path":"/hEdI56n4EHSP6kto7BUPEOb6bqo.png","name":"Associated Television","origin_country":"GB"}],"number_of_episodes":26,"number_of_seasons":1,"origin_country":["GB"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"UFO","overview":"A secret, high-technology international agency called SHADO defends Earth from alien invaders.","popularity":26.511,"poster_path":"/hJeWnELaBp5QGfTNE3S03h8ElpZ.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3448,"logo_path":"/dcA8JDfnnQPMaq8lv2CCiYrNe0S.png","name":"ITV","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":15,"id":8174,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/du2gpakKK3eF7WkDbY6O7yBS6fI.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1970-09-16","episode_count":26,"id":8173,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/zegZbrePgyYjL70xySD8kIl1Yev.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.1,"vote_count":31,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52573ceb760ee36aaa03b2fd","air_date":"1970-09-16","episodes":[{"air_date":"1970-09-16","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":198005,"name":"Identified","overview":"SHADO engages in its first battle with the enemy.
