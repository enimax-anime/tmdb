Party","overview":"Michael hosts a Christmas party at the office, but somehow manages to decrease the holiday cheer when he changes the arranged secret Santa pairs to a game of \"Yankee Swap\", where everyone gives their pre-bought presents to a different, random worker. To boost morale, Michael introduces vodka shots while the others compete for an iPod, Jim hopes that his sentimental present, meant for Pam, doesn't end up with Dwight, and Angela becomes enraged about Michael's party changes.","production_code":"02010","runtime":22,"season_number":2,"show_id":2316,"still_path":"/cjD1kUGSQEjeR6W17XPnB4agrXp.jpg","vote_average":8.4,"vote_count":25,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52573084760ee3776a340fa4","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":157771,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles McDougall","original_name":"Charles McDougall","popularity":2.953,"profile_path":"/ty4SFTBrT7g2j9ywxuwCbpmKdND.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257307f760ee3776a3407a3","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1226308,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Michael Schur","original_name":"Michael Schur","popularity":11.123,"profile_path":"/uFqjvTHNCfThf9ahEIYWFkszm9c.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Roy Anderson","credit_id":"5c91c3a4c3a3682ece4f3894","order":7,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":62562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Denman","original_name":"David Denman","popularity":16.699,"profile_path":"/4I06ZD8SQ6pU1QYShiUXb711fJW.jpg"},{"character":"Creed Bratton","credit_id":"525730ac760ee3776a344bc5","order":13,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85177,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Creed Bratton","original_name":"Creed Bratton","popularity":7.623,"profile_path":"/72hNnta4igAn2cE6fDyKElHcZ09.jpg"},{"character":"Kelly Kapoor","credit_id":"525730ac760ee3776a344b7b","order":14,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":125167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mindy Kaling","original_name":"Mindy Kaling","popularity":8.453,"profile_path":"/7ySdirSfk8U55nAXLiKBBbxyvvM.jpg"},{"character":"Meredith Palmer","credit_id":"525730ac760ee3776a344bfb","order":15,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":304282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kate Flannery","original_name":"Kate Flannery","popularity":11.006,"profile_path":"/wFXWKB2IUyB6Cu08PyovyBAm9WT.jpg"},{"character":"Stanley Hudson","credit_id":"525730ab760ee3776a344a87","order":16,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie David Baker","original_name":"Leslie David Baker","popularity":12.476,"profile_path":"/9h3xlV5IYqKinlQCW1ouU7sjwWF.jpg"},{"character":"Kevin Malone","credit_id":"525730a9760ee3776a3447f1","order":17,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94622,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brian Baumgartner","original_name":"Brian Baumgartner","popularity":8.852,"profile_path":"/1O7ECkD4mOKAgMAbQADBpTKBzOP.jpg"},{"character":"Darryl Philbin","credit_id":"525730ab760ee3776a344a3d","order":18,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64342,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Craig Robinson","original_name":"Craig Robinson","popularity":13.79,"profile_path":"/nWZI2ghokrha2lYnr5Z48agItL7.jpg"},{"character":"Phyllis Lapin","credit_id":"525730ab760ee3776a344b03","order":19,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":169200,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Phyllis Smith","original_name":"Phyllis Smith","popularity":19.268,"profile_path":"/h9w9pQbiderRWAC2mi7spjzuIGz.jpg"},{"character":"Óscar Martínez","credit_id":"525730ab760ee3776a3449d5","order":20,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":76094,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Oscar Nunez","original_name":"Oscar Nunez","popularity":11.54,"profile_path":"/UBILHiRphJdlshvsyH920QSAhk.jpg"},{"character":"Angela Martin","credit_id":"525730ab760ee3776a344a0b","order":21,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":113867,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angela Kinsey","original_name":"Angela Kinsey","popularity":16.587,"profile_path":"/5CqhutPYfVQC1mcTky2IU8o1R19.jpg"},{"character":"Toby Flenderson","credit_id":"5c91c4ad9251410feda75a30","order":22,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213125,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Lieberstein","original_name":"Paul Lieberstein","popularity":7.423,"profile_path":"/oLCaNVAw5cfE5q4e0PRsmHTuHfd.jpg"},{"character":"Todd Packer","credit_id":"5ca43a64c3a3685ab90bd582","order":758,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Koechner","original_name":"David Koechner","popularity":11.629,"profile_path":"/4zp1LzIOK2ls1cIo1coZYK02YpG.jpg"},{"character":"Bob Vance","credit_id":"5ca4304c0e0a26016aa80528","order":805,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37011,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert R.
