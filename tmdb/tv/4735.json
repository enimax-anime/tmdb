Somewhat more successful than previous television series involving invisible secret agents, it aired from June 9, 2000 to February 1, 2002, lasting two seasons.\n\nThe plot revolves around Darien Fawkes, a thief facing life imprisonment who was recruited by a low-rent spy organization and given the power of invisibility via implantation of a special \"Quicksilver gland\" in his head. The gland allows Fawkes to secrete a light-bending substance called \"Quicksilver\" from his pores and follicles. The substance quickly coats his skin, hair, nails and clothes and renders him invisible. He can consciously release the Quicksilver, which then flakes off and disintegrates. However, the Quicksilver gland was sabotaged at its creation by scientist Arnaud DeFehrn to release a neurotoxin that accumulates in the bloodstream and causes intense pain, followed by antisocial behavior and psychosis. The host requires regular doses of \"counteragent\" to keep him sane and healthy, which is controlled by said government agency. This series lasted for two seasons, before being cancelled due to cost issues and internal bickering between the Sci Fi Channel and its then-parent company, USA Networks. The show's first season ran concurrently in first-run syndication as well as on Sci Fi.","popularity":12.784,"poster_path":"/r2xvhDRpsQ8Oq3FlihPGDsND6vg.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6718,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stu Segall Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5856,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sci-Fi Channel","origin_country":"US"},{"id":16642,"logo_path":null,"name":"USA Network","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2000-06-09","episode_count":24,"id":14373,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/yx7NZ5ariHFimhj8jKVgZHjO0Ze.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":10},{"air_date":"2001-04-13","episode_count":22,"id":14374,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/k45YGDWissDxoo35oHJN66Q4pYv.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.067,"vote_count":45,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52577a14760ee36aaa56d932","air_date":"2000-06-09","episodes":[{"air_date":"2000-06-09","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":342398,"name":"Pilot (1)","overview":"Darien Fawkes is a con-man and thief who is captured for a third time.
