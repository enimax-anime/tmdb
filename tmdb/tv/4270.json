The show centered on the lives of six friends who share personal and professional experiences while living in a Brooklyn brownstone.\n\nThroughout its run, Living Single became one of the most popular African-American sitcoms of its era, ranking among the top five in African-American ratings in all five seasons. The series was produced by Yvette Lee Bowser's company, Sister Lee, in association with Warner Bros. Television. In contrast to the popularity of NBC's \"Must See TV\" on Thursday nights in the 1990s, many African American and Latino viewers flocked to Fox's Thursday night line-up of Martin, Living Single, and New York Undercover. In fact, these were the three highest-rated series among black households for the 1996–1997 season.","popularity":14.794,"poster_path":"/mgttYgspalxaLVrjJ9rxzDG9owO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1993-08-29","episode_count":27,"id":12556,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/yJ2Ru1n3zcCuSlzBxjk9eEGBzC4.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7},{"air_date":"1994-09-01","episode_count":27,"id":12558,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/esf0ByjI9vtXL6tcLhbW8nx9cZF.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1995-08-31","episode_count":27,"id":12557,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/AoGx0h4f3sAYuo0JGHk1mVZwm98.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1996-08-29","episode_count":24,"id":12559,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/ifTWTsl5AyrQKd3moIqEe27oTHo.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1997-09-11","episode_count":13,"id":12560,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/LKBe4pfJRpUYsy2Qq5jadRbDqq.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":39,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52576125760ee36aaa306d1d","air_date":"1993-08-29","episodes":[{"air_date":"1993-08-29","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":291836,"name":"Judging by the Cover","overview":"Regine boasts of a new beau, a guy with a limo--who also happens to have a wife.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":4270,"still_path":"/aBPV6ta9T12oA2gT5J89ewDrSd8.jpg","vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52576128760ee36aaa306e6b","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1213329,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yvette Lee Bowser","original_name":"Yvette Lee Bowser","popularity":1.786,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"52576128760ee36aaa306e9b","order":517,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":56040,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cylk Cozart","original_name":"Cylk Cozart","popularity":8.678,"profile_path":"/nk5nsCvNG8mUQfZPJU40EewtOGo.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1993-08-29","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":291835,"name":"I'll Take Your Man","overview":"Khadijah lands in the middle of a standoff between Regine and Max, who is dating Regine's latest cast-off.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":4270,"still_path":"/6Kkro1imd1SA5D9p9Wf9BcvsSoL.jpg","vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52576128760ee36aaa306e6b","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1213329,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Yvette Lee Bowser","original_name":"Yvette Lee Bowser","popularity":1.786,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"52576128760ee36aaa306e4b","order":513,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1236187,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Freda Payne","original_name":"Freda Payne","popularity":1.62,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":"1993-09-05","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":291832,"name":"Whose Date Is It Anyway?","overview":"Synclaire hasn't had a date in months, then a veterinarian asks her out, and suddenly she has a social calendar along with another dogged admirer.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":4270,"still_path":"/zwvbTtjI3iz9SCiXFfALrz1jZk5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"52576126760ee36aaa306d76","order":543,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":140503,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Thomas Mikal Ford","original_name":"Thomas Mikal Ford","popularity":6.01,"profile_path":"/oDTgRDjwTGviIYyZ42eoM44MOE5.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1993-09-12","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":291834,"name":"A Kiss Before Lying","overview":"Max's old beau breezes into town with his new fiancée, expecting Max to give him her blessing.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":4270,"still_path":"/qNg93v4gj2Cfsr35As6OLHkUgCU.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"52576126760ee36aaa306df8","order":528,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kellita Smith","original_name":"Kellita Smith","popularity":6.472,"profile_path":"/fH1yOmV3Fn0L0aaWbOtYSp0dj9Z.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"52576126760ee36aaa306e16","order":551,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103898,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeffrey D.
