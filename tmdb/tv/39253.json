Andrew Carlson (David Hornsby) is an etiquette columnist whose devotion to ideals from a more civilized time has lead to a life detached from modern society. Infectiously optimistic, Bert Lansing (Kevin Dillon) is a reformed \"bad boy\" from Andrew's past who inherited a fitness center, but can still be rude, loud and sloppy. When Andrew's editor, Jerry (Dave Foley), tells him to put a modern, sexy twist on his column or be fired, he hires Bert as a life coach in the hopes of learning to be less \"gentle man\" and more \"real man.\"","popularity":2.656,"poster_path":"/ti2XugPb4kjbbvkul0QByctAIMt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2011-09-29","episode_count":9,"id":50681,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":4.5,"vote_count":12,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258ef89760ee346618ed78b","air_date":"2011-09-29","episodes":[{"air_date":"2011-09-29","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":866095,"name":"Pilot","overview":"When an etiquette columnist is told to adapt to the modern and sexy style of his magazine, he turns to his former high-school bully for balance.","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":39253,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"56e3609c9251415b370004f7","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hornsby","original_name":"David Hornsby","popularity":11.007,"profile_path":"/wL20daMDqsa9ALA7EQrzgFyIMvz.jpg"},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"56e360789251416d43001322","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1222077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pamela Fryman","original_name":"Pamela Fryman","popularity":1.421,"profile_path":"/9k8InbzG0JOr0Vejoi0cubmc3KY.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-10-06","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":866096,"name":"How to Have a One-Night Stand","overview":"Bert instructs Andrew on how to enjoy a one-night fling without getting too attached emotionally, while Diane agrees to prep Mike for his green-card interview.","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":39253,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"56e3609c9251415b370004f7","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219546,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Hornsby","original_name":"David Hornsby","popularity":11.007,"profile_path":"/wL20daMDqsa9ALA7EQrzgFyIMvz.jpg"},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"56e360789251416d43001322","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1222077,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Pamela Fryman","original_name":"Pamela Fryman","popularity":1.421,"profile_path":"/9k8InbzG0JOr0Vejoi0cubmc3KY.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-10-15","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":866097,"name":"How to Attend Your Ex-Fiance's Wedding","overview":"Andrew attends his ex-fiancée's wedding and learns that she cheated on him with the groom while they were still together.","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":39253,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"56e360b9c3a3685aa000145e","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Savage","original_name":"Fred Savage","popularity":14.394,"profile_path":"/ux4TBPjG2kZDUlDiKb6eBK7BBFl.jpg"},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"56e361b99251415b5f000547","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236672,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeff Astrof","original_name":"Jeff Astrof","popularity":1.845,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-05-26","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":866098,"name":"How to Share a Relationship","overview":"Andrew and Bert each have their own unique relationship with the same woman, but Andrew starts to feel short-changed when she spends every night in Bert's room.","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":39253,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"56e360b9c3a3685aa000145e","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2223,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fred Savage","original_name":"Fred Savage","popularity":14.394,"profile_path":"/ux4TBPjG2kZDUlDiKb6eBK7BBFl.jpg"},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"56e361b99251415b5f000547","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236672,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jeff Astrof","original_name":"Jeff Astrof","popularity":1.845,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-05-26","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":866099,"name":"How to Be Draft Andrew","overview":"When Bert sends out angry emails that Andrew drafted but never sent, Andrew scrambles to make things right with the recipients.
