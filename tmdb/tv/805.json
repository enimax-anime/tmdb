It began in 1989 on BBC One and ran for four series, with the last episode shown in 1994. The show was a partially musical comic retelling of the legend of Robin Hood, placing Maid Marian in the role of leader of the Merry Men, and reducing Robin to an incompetent ex-tailor.\n\nThe programme was much appreciated by children and adults alike, and has been likened to Blackadder, not only for its historical setting and the presence of Tony Robinson, but also for its comic style. It is more surreal than Blackadder, however, and drops even more anachronisms. Many of the show's cast such as Howard Lew Lewis, Forbes Collins, Ramsay Gilderdale and Patsy Byrne had previously appeared in various episodes of Blackadder alongside Robinson. Like many British children's programmes, there is a lot of social commentary sneakily inserted, as well as witty asides about the Royal family, buses running on time, etc. Many of the plots spoofed or referenced film and television shows including other incarnations of Robin Hood in those mediums.","popularity":3.514,"poster_path":"/6baSwjPEaMn7egL8VP7P9dr2lcd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1993-12-24","episode_count":1,"id":96347,"name":"Specials","overview":"The 1993 Christmas special of the BBC TV comedy series 'Maid Marian and Her Merry Men'","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1989-11-16","episode_count":6,"id":68527,"name":"Season 1","overview":"It's a little known fact that Robin Hood was a complete wimp who tool all the credit for the grit in Maid Marian's Guts.
