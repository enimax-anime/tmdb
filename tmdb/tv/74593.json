From a unique species of elephant, and the world’s longest snake, to a crab almost a metre wide that climbs trees, these islands harbour a baffling number of large animals. And surrounded by teeming oceans, Indonesia is also home to the biggest fish on earth. It’s 17,000 islands include many diverse habitats, including the planet’s oldest rainforests, and over 120 active volcanoes. But how have the giant animals that have colonized these islands adapted in order to survive? And what happens when huge species collide, in this Kingdom of Giants?","production_code":"","runtime":44,"season_number":1,"show_id":74593,"still_path":"/w2M5qNz8LUDFH0CjMALTh0prTDa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5bdd0289c3a3682b34003d23","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Collis","original_name":"Colin Collis","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2016-12-04","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1610805,"name":"Islands of the Monsoon","overview":"Cloaked in tropical rainforest and warmed by clear blue seas Indonesia is a paradise for a unique range of species. Although much of the island chain receives sporadic rain throughout the year, this alone wouldn’t be enough to sustain the region’s rich abundance of life. Fortunately, Indonesia lies in the heart of monsoon territory, and we discover how creatures have learnt to thrive and capitalize on some of the most powerful rainstorms on the planet.","production_code":"","runtime":44,"season_number":1,"show_id":74593,"still_path":"/6ayAMUiLbmlhRUxrDP4Yg4BZsGW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5bdd0289c3a3682b34003d23","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2013708,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Collis","original_name":"Colin Collis","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2016-12-11","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1610806,"name":"Volcano Nation","overview":"The island chain of Indonesia is home to more active volcanoes than any other country in the world. Yet somehow, instead of posing a threat – this volcanic activity is a source of life. The 130 volcanoes have transformed the islands from isolated mountains of hot lava, to lush jungle homes. For millions of years rich fertile ash has supported pristine rainforests, allowing life to flourish. Indonesia’s 17,000 islands house more mammals than anywhere else in the world. Those residents have uniquely adapted to the specific demands of life in the furnace. From birds that lay their eggs in volcanic ash, to bears that can climb the world’s tallest trees and bearded pigs that wallow in Borneo’s Mud Volcano.","production_code":"","runtime":44,"season_number":1,"show_id":74593,"still_path":"/aoMYr8nyySALAedNTxRFUWT0fc2.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2016-12-18","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":1610807,"name":"Secret Worlds","overview":"Scattered across the warm South China Sea, Indonesia’s islands are a melting pot for evolution and diversity.
