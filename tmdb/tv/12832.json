Though it shares a title with the feature film The Hunger the series has no direct plot or character connection to the film, and was created by Jeff Fazio.\n\nOriginally shown on the Sci Fi Channel in the UK, The Movie Network in Canada and Showtime in the US, the series was broadcast from 1997 to 2000, and is internally organized into two seasons. Each episode was based around an independent story introduced by the host; Terence Stamp hosted each episode for the first season, and was replaced in the second season by David Bowie. Stories tended to focus on themes of self-destructive desire and obsession, with a strong component of soft-core erotica; popular tropes for the stories included cannibalism, vampires, sex, and poison.","popularity":43.33,"poster_path":"/1LZGVWHxJIHPu7FnXWlVaK5JrPo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1645,"logo_path":"/6Ry6uNBaa0IbbSs1XYIgX5DkA9r.png","name":"Scott Free Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":3,"id":23764,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1997-07-20","episode_count":22,"id":23762,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/6cyQc25nPsHveyvRhr2mXBGAKAJ.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1999-09-10","episode_count":22,"id":23763,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/ahYfCXTm5Z5Zch69ZS38W1bn62F.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.652,"vote_count":23,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525823c2760ee36aaa7de5ad","air_date":"1997-07-20","episodes":[{"air_date":"1997-07-20","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":488351,"name":"The Swords","overview":"A man gets into a relationship with a woman who can survive being peirced by swords.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":12832,"still_path":"/wAcZEuy5jzUfEpBb7VIzYaano5A.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525823c2760ee36aaa7de5f5","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":893,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Tony Scott","original_name":"Tony Scott","popularity":9.085,"profile_path":"/zEEbiNa8Pqw3U6pZ8Z2y3dlJJnC.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"525823c2760ee36aaa7de5db","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9191,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timothy Spall","original_name":"Timothy Spall","popularity":23.292,"profile_path":"/kcXnzkIPUHgCFtWQ7sUjQCrSIME.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1997-07-20","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":488352,"name":"Menage a Trois","overview":"A wheelchair bound woman uses her nurse in a plan to seduce a young workman.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":12832,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"525823c2760ee36aaa7de618","order":505,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8784,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Craig","original_name":"Daniel Craig","popularity":42.183,"profile_path":"/iFerDZUmC5Fu26i4qI8xnUVEHc7.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525823c3760ee36aaa7de62e","order":508,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":8963,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Black","original_name":"Karen Black","popularity":14.323,"profile_path":"/3BFJomfmLFiQ2Wsc0eNK0PQs3d3.jpg"},{"character":"Steph Reynolds","credit_id":"525823c3760ee36aaa7de644","order":509,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":17286,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lena Headey","original_name":"Lena Headey","popularity":38.268,"profile_path":"/rKoDN3VOIkvoubUsuYXgMe93hJW.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1997-07-20","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":488353,"name":"Necros","overview":"A man named Philip Casnoff falls for a beautiful woman.
