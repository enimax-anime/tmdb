The show was set in a German prisoner of war camp during World War II. Bob Crane starred as Colonel Robert E. Hogan, coordinating an international crew of Allied prisoners running a Special Operations group from the camp. Werner Klemperer played Colonel Wilhelm Klink, the commandant of the camp, and John Banner was the inept sergeant-of-the-guard, Hans Schultz.\n\nThe series was popular during its six-season run. In 2013, creators Bernard Fein through his estate and Albert S. Ruddy acquired the sequel and other separate rights to Hogan's Heroes from Mark Cuban through arbitration and a movie based on the show has been planned.","popularity":244.748,"poster_path":"/qifpp3AmNx54Ko4obdwxOWNf0lo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":10211,"logo_path":null,"name":"Alfran Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":5409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bing Crosby Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":2161,"logo_path":"/kaHPCUD2nQ1DGWDAH3zbYVCkTae.png","name":"CBS Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":6,"id":12049,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1965-09-17","episode_count":32,"id":12043,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/hI8W4kmgUmJ9G8H8aeMyWp1CGqy.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":8.3},{"air_date":"1966-09-16","episode_count":30,"id":12044,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/sfeu1cqQZsvhlAHot8zWZj2QzEZ.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":8.5},{"air_date":"1967-09-09","episode_count":30,"id":12045,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/7xW29hmZXLppiOEyVqmjyv68dLp.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":8.4},{"air_date":"1968-09-28","episode_count":26,"id":12046,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/8RmdPAyPc4Tava4vGmTe2rVF1RA.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1969-09-26","episode_count":26,"id":12047,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/jsvlBOxBoCaiDezvp8Pnzz7OLMg.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1970-09-20","episode_count":24,"id":12048,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":"/l1h8yvzEGnzJeeAyKa0SXHJL4D1.jpg","season_number":6,"vote_average":1}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.539,"vote_count":129,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52575b38760ee36aaa2b1a9a","air_date":"1965-09-17","episodes":[{"air_date":"1965-09-17","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":283218,"name":"The Informer","overview":"At Stalag 13, a German prisoner-of-war camp, Colonel Robert Hogan and his fellow cohorts are a subversive group with many hidden talents.
