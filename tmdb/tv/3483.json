Sometimes an object might seem to be at rest, even when it is in motion. It’s all relative. Relative motion, that is. How things appear to move depends on how you, or any observer, happens to be moving. So, if you’re on a bus looking out a window into another bus, and your bus begins to back up slowly, you may think the other bus is moving forward, when really it’s not moving at all. That’s motion in motion.

Balloons inflate because air presses on the insides   and outsides of the balloon. Air pressure in tires supports the weight of bikes, buses, trucks, cars, and   planes. But air doesn't need to be inside something to exert pressure. Air that moves around pushes,   too.   What do birds, planes, kites, Frisbees, and helicopters have in common? They fly because moving air   creates lift, or a push up. Airplane wings are shaped to push air down. The momentum of the air going   down pushes wings up. Air above the wing gets going faster than the air underneath. Fast-moving air   zips along, without pushing as hard side to side or up and down.

You, and every living thing we know of, live on or in the Earth's crust.   And, living things need the Earth's crust to survive. Let's look at the science of the surface.   By carefully studying the Earth's surface, scientists have discovered that the Earth is made up of gigantic   layers. At the center of the Earth, there is a core â€“ a big ball of solid metal mostly iron.   The core is surrounded by a layer of liquid iron and other minerals. We usually just call it the outer core.   The next layer, around the outer core is called the mantle. You may have seen a mantle above a fireplace.   Well, the mantle is above the Earth's hot core places.

Luckily for paleontologists (scientists   who study the past), now and then dinosaurs died, and their bones were covered by mud, or sand. As   the bones sat protected from weather, they absorbed minerals from the soil around them. The minerals   chemically worked their way into the bones. Millions of years later, we can find them and dig them up.   Humans were not around to see what actually killed the ancient dinosaurs.

Your skin stops you from drying out, protects you   from the weather, and keeps bacteria and viruses from getting inside your body.   Your skin is also your personal air conditioner and heater all in one. Sweating cools you off. When you're   hot, glands in your skin push a mixture of water and other chemicals onto the surface of your skin. When   the water evaporates, it takes some of the heat with it, and you're cooler. When you're too cold, your skin   muscles start twitching. Shivering makes your body warm up.

You get these vital chemicals through a process called \"\"digestion.\"\" Your body breaks   food down and grabs all the nutrients you need from it. Then, your body gets rid of what's left over.   Digestion starts in your mouth. You begin breaking food down by breaking it into pieces with your teeth   and jaw muscles. Your saliva (your spit) is full of chemicals that react with the chemicals in food and   make them break apart. Then you swallow.

Everything around us is made of stuff called matter, and all matter is made of atoms. Matter is anything   that comes in three varieties, what scientists call phases. There are solids like rocks, cookies, and desks.   There are liquids like water, honey, and juice. And there are gases, we breathe air and the helium in   balloons. The main difference between the three phases is how fast the matter's atoms move.   All atoms move around because they have energy. The more energy that's in something, the faster the   atoms move. Atoms in an ice cube don't move very much - they're frozen in place. The atoms in liquid   water slip and slide around - that's why you can pour it and spill it.

Luckily, our ecosystem covers a big part of the Earth, and there are lots of different plants to eat. Ecosystems   are not as simple as one living thing eating another, as the corn example. The lives of animals and plants   are intertwined - what happens to one animal can have an impact on all sorts of living things.   As humans, we have a big effect on the other living things around us. We are the only animals to leave   lots of stuff around, such as houses, cars, and malls.

Let Bill Nye   push and pull you around ramps, levers, screws, and pulleys.   Simple machines simply make work easier by directing forces over distances. Instead of lifting a heavy   box upstairs, you can hook it to some ropes and pulleys and pull it up. Or you can get a ramp and slide   it upstairs. Either way, it's less sweat to use the pulleys or the ramp than it is to lift the box straight up   by yourself because the force you need is more spread out. Levers, ramps, screws, wheels, wedges, and   pulleys are all simple machines designed to direct forces.   With simple machines we don't have to push or pull as hard, but we have to push or pull over a longer   distance. It's easier to walk up a long set of stairs to the top of the Empire State Building than it would   be to climb a ladder to the top, but the set of stairs would be much longer than the ladder.

The Moon is the closest thing in space to Earth, and it's one of   the most well-studied orbs in our solar system. We know that Moon rocks are rich in calcium and aluminum,   that the Moon has no atmosphere, and that there are over a million craters on the Moon's surface. The   Moon doesn't glow on its own, it reflects sunlight.   Watch the Moon every night for a month as it grows, shrinks, and at one point disappears. The Moon   doesn't actually change it's shape. It's the way the sun shines on the part of the Moon we see that makes   the phases change. The Earth moves around the Sun, the Moon moves around the Earth.

Electricity is the flow of   electrons, and electrons are very tiny charged particles. Electrons are found in atoms, the tiny pieces that   all stuff is made from. We can make electrons flow in two ways. Batteries make electricity by mixing up   chemicals -- making a chemical reaction that forces electrons to move in a path from the battery to the   personal stereo and back to the battery.

What more could you ask from a friend?   Blood patrols your entire body. Blood is pushed around by a powerful pump called the heart. Every time   your heart lub-dubs, blood is propelled through tubes called arteries, capillaries, and veins. Your heat   pushes your blood in a complete loop around your body about 2,000 times every day.   Your heart is a muscle, and, like all muscles, it can get stronger.

Light is energy that normally moves in a straight line, but often something gets in the way. When light runs into something, three things can happen - the light can bounce off, it can go through, or it can be absorbed. Often all three things happen at the same time. Light bounces off mirrors. You see yourself in a mirror when light bounces off your face, into the mirror, and then into your eyes. Light goes through glass. If the glass is bent or curved, the light gets bent on its way out of the glass. The glass in a magnifying glass or a pair of eyeglasses is curved so that it bends light, making things look bigger. More light is absorbed by dark-colored things than by light-colored things. Colors are made when some light is absorbed while other light is bounced back.

Bones and muscles work together, or you aren't going anywhere. Muscles always pull, even when you push on something like a door somewhere in your body your arm and leg muscles are in tension. They are all attached to bones, and those bones are pushing; they're in compression. By pulling on bones you can breathe, talk, and move all over the world. Your bones support your weight like beams of steel or wood. They're stiff and strong. Rigid as they might seem though, they do flex. And, if you bang one hard enough, it swells up. You have a lump. That's because bones are full of blood vessels. Bones are not solid like rocks or skeletons in a dinosaur museum. Bones flex and grow.

It depends how you count, but you can say that there are five oceans on Earth - the Atlantic, the Pacific, the Indian, the Arctic, and the Antarctic. They are all connected into one World Ocean by the flow of ocean currents. Ocean water is moving around all the time. Some of the moving water forms rivers in the ocean. Oceanographers, scientists who study oceans, call these rivers of ocean water \"currents\". Currents help sea animals move around, they bring up deep ocean water with lots of nutrients for small animals to eat, and they push warm and cold water around, creating different climates in the oceans.

Snow cones, flowers, hot dogs, people -- everything is made of molecules. No matter what they're in, solid, liquid, or gas, molecules are always moving, even if just a little bit. The speed of the molecules depends on their temperature. Cold things have slow-moving molecules, while hot things have fast-moving molecules. In fact, temperature is really a measurement of molecule speed. For a cold thing to get warm, its molecules have to speed up. Heat moves in three different ways -- conduction, convection, and radiation. Conduction is the flow of heat between two solid objects that are touching. Heat conducts from your warm fingertips into a cold can of soda. Convection is the transfer of heat with a liquid or gas.

Instead, they have hard shells called exoskeletons. Like a little suit of armor, an exoskeleton protects the insect's body and also keeps it from drying out. Although people call any crawling critter with an exoskeleton a \"bug\", the \"true bugs\" are insects that have special mouth parts for piercing and sucking. And, spiders are not bugs or even insects. They're built differently with only two main body parts and eight legs instead of six. If you think you have a wild time growing up, take a look at an insect's life. Most insects go through at least four stages of growth -- egg (little round thing), larva (a bit like a worm), pupa (insect in a cocoon), and adult. It's a long road to maturity for an insect.

A force is a push or a pull. You can feel a force when someone pushes you. You can use a force to pull a door shut. Anyone can make forces by pushing and pulling, and you don't need to be Luke Skywalker to use a force. In a game of tug-of-war, if the pull of your team is the same as the pull of the other team, the forces are equal. The two teams are in balance, and the rope doesn't budge. Things are in balance when forces that are pushing or pulling them are equal. If your tug-of-war team pulls harder than the other team, the forces are not equal. The other team falls all over the place. Unequal forces make things move and twist. A lot of things are designed to take advantage of unequal forces.

To do that in the ocean isn’t easy. Water soaks up heat, so the ocean is really pretty cold. Marine mammals have all sorts of ways to keep warm. Whales, dolphins, and walruses have thick layers of fat called “blubber.” It’s great insulation. It holds their body heat keeping them warm in the cold ocean. Sea otters have thick layers of fur that cover their whole bodies. Otters fluff their fur to trap air between the hairs.

The majority of earthquakes occur along plate boundaries such as the boundary between the Pacific Plate and the North American plate.

Animals are milked, corralled, fed, sheared, slaughtered or cleaned-up after.","production_code":"","runtime":26,"season_number":5,"show_id":3483,"still_path":"/YG8HekMIWFb9TV6wf4hi237w3W.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1997-11-14","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":251085,"name":"Life Cycles","overview":"My, how you’ve grown! The popular exclamation from your Auntie may be no great revelation, but growing bigger is a part of life. In fact, it’s part of the whole cycle, or pattern, of human life that began with your birth. The different stages in life are called life cycles. Humans aren’t the only ones with life cycles. At first, you might think that you have nothing in common with a cactus in the desert, or a fish in the sea, or the mold in your gym shoe, but you do. You’re all alive. You all have or will experience birth, growth, reproduction, aging, and eventually, death.","production_code":"","runtime":26,"season_number":5,"show_id":3483,"still_path":"/65jlQhkHz6rlUpNBiLk5uvopDpu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Self","credit_id":"64d83618f14dad00ad4f539f","order":504,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":69597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Drew Barrymore","original_name":"Drew Barrymore","popularity":24.161,"profile_path":"/uSj402URh6CSSnVpZsL90f0PYIG.jpg"},{"character":"Announcer","credit_id":"64d83639069f0e01018fa7f6","order":505,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1237049,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pat Cashman","original_name":"Pat Cashman","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/1lqanrY4syuoGgoBozGIpSws6Rk.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1997-11-21","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":251087,"name":"Do-It-Yourself Science","overview":"Do-it-yourself science involves a question, observations, a hypothesis, and experimentation. You have probably come up with questions after you noticed something unusual. For instance, why do fingers get all pruny and wrinkled when I sit in the tub? The observation – shriveled fingertips – is the first step. Do-it-yourself science requires an eye for details surrounding your observations. Collecting related information helps you get to the next step, what scientists call a hypothesis, or “educated” guess. After weighing all the evidence, you hypothesize that your fingers get pruny because of the hot water in the tub. Once you have a hypothesis, it’s time for the fun part – testing it out.","production_code":"","runtime":26,"season_number":5,"show_id":3483,"still_path":"/mpSGYGf5QSt1p6l9V5s0ynU36Hd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1997-11-28","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"standard","id":251086,"name":"Atoms & Molecules","overview":"Atoms are reeeeally small. They are so small that you can’t see them with just your eye. It takes as many as 10 million of them side-by-side to measure a single millimeter. In fact, atoms are the smallest pieces of “stuff” that are still considered “stuff.” If you take something and break it into tiny pieces, and then break it into tinier pieces, and keep going, the smallest part you’d be left with (and still have the same substance that you started with) is an atom. Atoms are the building blocks of all matter. Everything is made of only 109 different kinds of atoms, called elements. 92 of these elements occur naturally, but the rest of them – ones like Technetium and Promethium have only been found in distant stars and Californium and Einsteinium – are only made in laboratories. A molecule is born any time two or more atoms combine together.\n\nEnglish","production_code":"","runtime":26,"season_number":5,"show_id":3483,"still_path":"/e9svko19vYu3JamdYclwSLKIQcW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1997-12-05","episode_number":9,"episode_type":"standard","id":251088,"name":"Ocean Exploration","overview":"Ocean exploration is a tricky, risky business since humans can’t naturally survive under the ocean.

Over the last few hundred years or so, and especially in the last few decades, we humans have come up with all kinds of new ways to study the ocean. Even so, the ocean remains largely unexplored. It’s huge, cold, salty, and deep.

Objects give off tiny amounts of tiny molecules into the air. When just a few of these molecules get up your nose, they dissolve in the mucus up there. Some molecules come into contact with special receptors on what’s called your “olfactory membranes.” Each nostril has a membrane, and each membrane is only about the size of a postage stamp. The membranes hold millions of receptor cells, each of which are ready to send messages to the brain about the molecules that go up your nose.","production_code":"","runtime":26,"season_number":5,"show_id":3483,"still_path":"/wbKGPtG5ADg50dkR2FbTXQHInBv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1998-04-25","episode_number":12,"episode_type":"standard","id":251090,"name":"Caves","overview":"Caves come in all different shapes and sizes depending on how they were formed.

Where do these wild, dangerous, and necessary tornadoes, hurricanes, and thunderstorms come from? Storms happen when huge different air masses collide. Along the border of these air masses, water vapor condenses into clouds, strong winds form, and the clouds rub against each other with the ground often becoming electrically charged waiting to send lightning bolts across the sky.

Or that a giant redwood can be as tall as a 35-story apartment building? The only reason we can make these comparisons is because people have measured these things. We don’t compare jets and snails every day, but we do rely on measurement constantly. When you take your temperature, you find out how it compares to the temperature of someone who is healthy. When you bake brownies, you’ll need to measure the ingredients first to make sure they turn out tasty.

A sad song can say more about how someone feels than most words, and a familiar song can make crowds clap together and feel like one happy family. Whatever the emotion, music seems to have a way to communicate it. The music we listen to today is the result of years of experimentation with sounds. As people figured out what they liked best, they invented instruments that could play their favorite tones and developed popular rhythms, or patterns of beats. Each note of music, and every tone of each instrument is a sound wave. Some sound waves sound great together. Some not so good. Getting the exact soundwaves in the pattern you want – now that’s science.","production_code":"","runtime":26,"season_number":5,"show_id":3483,"still_path":"/pMXCd8Voj0hm29Rw1ALbb9BRXQY.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1998-06-20","episode_number":20,"episode_type":"finale","id":251099,"name":"Motion","overview":"Things can appear to be moving, when they really aren’t. Sometimes an object might seem to be at rest, even when it is in motion. It’s all relative. Relative motion, that is. How things appear to move depends on how you, or any observer, happens to be moving. So, if you’re on a bus looking out a window into another bus, and your bus begins to back up slowly, you may think the other bus is moving forward, when really it’s not moving at all. That’s motion in motion.
