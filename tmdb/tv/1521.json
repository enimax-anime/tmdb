The pilot first aired on May 7, 1977, and the series followed as a mid-season replacement in February 1978. The series was cancelled in April 1978. Quark was created by Buck Henry, co-creator of the spy spoof Get Smart.\n\nThe show was set on a United Galaxy Sanitation Patrol Cruiser, an interstellar garbage scow operating out of United Galaxies Space Station Perma One in the year 2226. Adam Quark, the main character, works to clean up trash in space by collecting \"space baggies\" with his trusted and highly unusual crew.\n\nIn its short run, Quark satirized such science fiction as Star Wars, 2001: A Space Odyssey and Flash Gordon. Three of the episodes were direct satires of Star Trek episodes.\n\nThe series won one Emmy Award nomination, for costume designer Grady Hunt's work in the episode \"All the Emperor's Quasi-Norms, Part 2\".\n\nThe complete series was released on DVD on October 14, 2008.","popularity":5.824,"poster_path":"/jzHndascxtvxE6FtAczjIymckS7.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16126,"logo_path":null,"name":"David Gerber Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3614,"logo_path":"/qFRpYYtU9iyVKDMpm3a8tN7Q7YE.png","name":"Columbia Pictures Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1977-05-07","episode_count":8,"id":4137,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/vDtvVk41bAatbHHNTTqPasnyf00.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.7,"vote_count":13,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52570b2e19c2957114000eee","air_date":"1977-05-07","episodes":[{"air_date":"1977-05-07","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":74766,"name":"Quark","overview":"An expanding enzyme cloud threatens to destroy the galaxy.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":1521,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52570b2e19c2957114000f32","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":120552,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hy Averback","original_name":"Hy Averback","popularity":1.527,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52570b2e19c2957114000f22","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7795,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Buck Henry","original_name":"Buck Henry","popularity":4.285,"profile_path":"/iAOjaj5OHMMXno65MwmDtkqHeb6.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"The High Gorgon","credit_id":"52570b2e19c2957114000f04","order":501,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14731,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Henry Silva","original_name":"Henry Silva","popularity":21.732,"profile_path":"/lPXDv2K8tkFMnEQsDGmeIMSPxiq.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1978-02-24","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":74769,"name":"May the Source Be with You","overview":"Perma One is in a state of emergency as Gorgon has created the ultimate weapon to defeat the United Galaxy.
