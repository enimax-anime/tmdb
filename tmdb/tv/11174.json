Bodie is a cynical ex-SAS paratrooper and mercenary whose nature ran to controlled violence, while his partner, Doyle, comes to CI5 from the regular police force, and is more of an open minded liberal.

Many of its themes are as relevant today as they were then. The constantly elliptical script (\"I want you to see that he'sâ€¦ well taken care of\") is tremendous fun. And despite the macho drive, the whole thing has a camp archness which betrays its Avengers pedigree.

years, milking the dramatic potential of a rich gamut of scenarios, from international espionage to racism and religious evangelism; Bodie and Doyle usually being called upon to protect a controversial figure from the assassin's bullet. Shaw would later dismiss The Professionals for its stereotypical violence and for a long time refused to allow reruns. In fact, as cult television goes, it has weathered well. Many of its themes are as relevant today as they were then. The constantly elliptical script (\"I want you to see that he'sâ€¦ well taken care of\") is tremendous fun. And despite the macho drive, the whole thing has a camp archness which betrays its Avengers pedigree. Great for a nostalgic wallow.","id":59909,"poster_path":"/aeDKgOkjK0uyuajRrff5fTHgS4M.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},"2":{"_id":"52fe4c4a92514168c00207dc","air_date":"1978-10-07","episodes":[{"air_date":"1978-10-07","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1001930,"name":"Hunter/Hunted","overview":"Cowley assigns Doyle to test a brand new high-tech laser beam rifle.
