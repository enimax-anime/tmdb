At a job interview, she starts down her dark path in earnest, when she tells a simple lie about her education. From there, the tale of Miss Ripley weaves into the lives of two very important rivals: Jang Myung Hoon and Yutaka, both of whom are in the hotel industry and fall in love with the deceitful protagonist. To complicate things, Mi Ri's childhood acquaintance, Hee Joo, can see through all the lies.","popularity":6.119,"poster_path":"/48L2PVRc54iqgyah4HXjDHAK5aP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":63013,"logo_path":null,"name":"Curtain Call
