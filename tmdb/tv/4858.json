The thirteen-episode season ended on 23 June 2008.\n\nThe season introduced a new patrol boat, following the decommissioning of the original, Fremantle class boat in the final scenes of season one. The new HMAS Hammersley was of the Armidale class, reflecting the real-life changeover in the Australian fleet. The second season also featured the debut of a new main character, Able Seaman Rebecca \"Bomber\" Brown, as the boat's new cook.\n\nThough advertised by the Nine Network as Sea Patrol II: The Coup, episodes themselves bore no title other than Sea Patrol, and the ISAN number indicated that the episodes were merely episodes 14–26 of Sea Patrol.\n\nContinuing the format from the first season, episodes generally moved a season-long story arc along. As the Nine Network marketing indicated, this arc involved a coup on the Samaru Islands, a fictional island nation close to Australia. In many ways, the story was evocative of Operation ANODE, a peacekeeping mission to the Solomon Islands that has been called \"the [operational] pinnacle for the Fremantle class\" by the Australian Department of Defence.","poster_path":"/4NCMZuQZfNP9QlyqHqADbNOckMW.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":9.5},{"air_date":"2009-05-18","episode_count":13,"id":14578,"name":"Season 3","overview":"The third season of the Australian drama Sea Patrol premiered as Sea Patrol 3: Red Gold on the Nine Network on 18 May 2009.

The continued presence of the production in north Queensland has been hailed as \"a major boon for our local film and television industry\" by Rod Welford, the Queensland Minister for Education, Training and the Arts. Sea Patrol season 3 finished filming in mid-February. The series kicked off with ET being killed in a diving accident. Sea Patrol 3 still has the Armidale Class Patrol Boat.

The thirteen-episode season ended on 23 June 2008.\n\nThe season introduced a new patrol boat, following the decommissioning of the original, Fremantle class boat in the final scenes of season one. The new HMAS Hammersley was of the Armidale class, reflecting the real-life changeover in the Australian fleet. The second season also featured the debut of a new main character, Able Seaman Rebecca \"Bomber\" Brown, as the boat's new cook.\n\nThough advertised by the Nine Network as Sea Patrol II: The Coup, episodes themselves bore no title other than Sea Patrol, and the ISAN number indicated that the episodes were merely episodes 14–26 of Sea Patrol.\n\nContinuing the format from the first season, episodes generally moved a season-long story arc along. As the Nine Network marketing indicated, this arc involved a coup on the Samaru Islands, a fictional island nation close to Australia. In many ways, the story was evocative of Operation ANODE, a peacekeeping mission to the Solomon Islands that has been called \"the [operational] pinnacle for the Fremantle class\" by the Australian Department of Defence.","id":14580,"poster_path":"/4NCMZuQZfNP9QlyqHqADbNOckMW.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":9.5},"3":{"_id":"52577b03760ee36aaa57bc7d","air_date":"2009-05-18","episodes":[{"air_date":"2009-05-18","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":344372,"name":"Catch and Release","overview":"The crew of Hammersley is rocked by the mysterious death of a much-loved shipmate.
