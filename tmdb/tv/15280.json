A blackout sees her arrive home drunk in the back of the cab. When the police arrive on her doorstep with the news her car was found abandoned and smashed, she finds herself inadvertently withholding information which results in the police thinking her car was stolen. What Lauren comes to remember is quite different — and damaging. She got drunk, drove her car, careened it into a public place and travelled home passed out in a taxi. Mel lands back at 232 with a huge surprise. She's adopted a baby. Something which has happened swiftly and, judging from her nervousness, a role she's not all together convinced she's ready for. Sean however discovers he has a natural instinct with the baby and so, well aware of Mel's insecurities, offers to venture back to Abu Dhabi to help her settle into motherhood.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"2010-02-09","episode_number":10,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":3,"show_id":15280,"still_path":null},"name":"Satisfaction","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":1630,"logo_path":"/aE73SvqF48ZdeMQ0Ls8kzxiikwL.png","name":"showcase","origin_country":"AU"}],"number_of_episodes":30,"number_of_seasons":3,"origin_country":["AU"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Satisfaction","overview":"Set in and around 232, an up-market city brothel, Satisfaction reveals the world of five high class escorts and their manager as they juggle the pressures of their private lives with their secret profession.","popularity":9.171,"poster_path":"/fuEsTpkM40vwhynt7XBS56ajP9p.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":139163,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lonehand Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AU","name":"Australia"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":3,"id":26883,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2007-12-05","episode_count":10,"id":26881,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/b9HYDLD81kJrtrROFav3zibVdiQ.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2008-12-02","episode_count":10,"id":26880,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/usj7EfYweuhgRDyiTjkD9A0pgtI.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2009-12-08","episode_count":10,"id":26882,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/vXRrL74yCRUqameBwye2QFGCWOr.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":17,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52583934760ee36aaa9770c5","air_date":"2007-12-05","episodes":[{"air_date":"2007-12-05","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":537799,"name":"Running Girl","overview":"Satisfaction is a Showcase Original Presentation about friendships, family, lust and love and is unlike anything seen on Australian television.
