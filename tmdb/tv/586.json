The title character, Sammo Law, portrayed by Sammo Hung, was a Chinese law officer and martial arts expert who came to Los Angeles in search of a colleague and remains in the US.\n\nThe show was a surprise hit, making Hung the only East Asian headlining a prime-time network series in the United States. At the time, Hung was not fluent in English, and he reportedly recited some of his dialogue phonetically. In many scenes, Hung did not speak at all, making Martial Law perhaps the only US television series in history that featured so little dialogue from the lead character.","popularity":17.847,"poster_path":"/iLseFnM1UwzHLQxnNTiCqfRMgkx.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cuse Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":6137,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ruddy Morgan Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":1556,"logo_path":"/31h94rG9hzjprXoYNy3L1ErUya2.png","name":"20th Century Fox Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":2161,"logo_path":"/kaHPCUD2nQ1DGWDAH3zbYVCkTae.png","name":"CBS Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1998-09-26","episode_count":22,"id":1787,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/9Ed9yBmKOAHeUizwiJjq1gZBoUg.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":8},{"air_date":"1999-09-25","episode_count":22,"id":1786,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/zoCneZ21qdD08f3Pyzc8PHlrtR4.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7,"vote_count":64,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525388e619c295794022e703","air_date":"1998-09-26","episodes":[{"air_date":"1998-09-26","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":33809,"name":"Shanghai Express","overview":"Sammo's comes to America to find one of his colleagues from China who has disappeared whilst infiltrating an international car theft ring.
