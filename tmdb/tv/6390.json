With a whopping million-pound budget, they want a magical property that will inspire their creativity. On a more practical level, the house must have five bedrooms, a large kitchen-diner where the family can congregate, and a library, or space to create one. As they want an organic smallholding, the property must also come with up to 30 acres of land. Finding a house that fits the bill won't be difficult - finding a house that feels right may be trickier.",
