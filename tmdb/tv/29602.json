Shimizu and Sophia don't have the closest feelings for each other, but they realize that only one of them can win. While in Japan Goro is visited by Toshi, and the two contemplate how they can become a tandem in the Major Leagues. Goro makes his final decision. A few seasons pass by. Goro is back as the closer for the Hornets. Watts is his set up man. Toshi is the catcher, and the World Series features the Hornets against the Raiders. The Raiders have only continued to improve as they acquired Keene from the Hornets and now have a pitching coach named Joe Gibson. Mayumura is their closer. The Hornets lead by one run, and Goro is on the mound facing Gibson Junior. Clips are shown of all the stars in Major, including their final outcomes. The final episode has arrived, but it's one you won't want to miss.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"2010-09-25","episode_number":25,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":6,"show_id":29602,"still_path":"/jlmAMtqI9z30mgGuekS0oi0nA1g.jpg"},"name":"Major","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":219,"logo_path":"/yggDLcQ3huw76ee2tQRfsMrt0Yh.png","name":"NHK BS1","origin_country":"JP"}],"number_of_episodes":154,"number_of_seasons":6,"origin_country":["JP"],"original_language":"ja","original_name":"メジャー","overview":"Honda Goro the son of a famous baseball player loves nothing more than baseball itself.
