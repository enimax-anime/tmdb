For the second season the series switched to Sci-Fi Channel in early 2000. The series stars Clayton Rohner, Richard Brooks and Marshall Bell.\n\nG vs E pitted a group of agents who are assigned to \"the Corps\", a secret agency under the command of Heaven, against the \"Morlocks\", a group of evildoers from Hell.\n\nThe series has a 1970s retro-hip style that is similar to Quentin Tarantino's Pulp Fiction. The show is fast-moving and harkens back to the blaxploitation films of the 1970s. It also mixes spy-fi elements with the end of the millennium Zeitgeist of the late 1990s.\n\nNBC Universal's horror-themed cable channel Chiller, which launched on March 1, 2007, aired G vs. E as part of its premiere schedule.","popularity":3.232,"poster_path":"/stIL7Cu3MVoGcOI1ZYFQW5FQSzw.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1999-07-18","episode_count":11,"id":21387,"name":"Season
