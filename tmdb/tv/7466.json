Scientists are quick to recognize that these creatures, equipped with a deeply recurved sickle-shaped claw, do not fit into the image of a slow-moving, cold-blooded dinosaur. Lying next to the skeletons of these raptors were the remains of a large plant-eating dinosaur called Tenontosaurus. Modern CAT Scanners help scientists get a never-before-seen look into how these animals moved, fought and behaved. Watch as experts recreate what happened when a pack of deadly raptors took on an adversary more than twice their own size.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":7466,"still_path":"/u4ujkhfY5ZiN8o1taQJyYP35fGx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2008-08-19","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":387869,"name":"Bloodiest Battle","overview":"Discover a prehistoric watering hole where multiple dinosaur species fought to the death under the intense heat of a Jurassic drought.
