After being dissatisfied with the falafel and shawarma offerings in New York, Freddy took matters into his own hands by starting King of Falafel & Shawarma in 2002. Since then, his enterprise has grown, with a truck in Astoria, a cart in Midtown, and a newly opened restaurant in Queens.  They also serve chicken over rice, kebabs, meatballs, and other Palestinian specialties. As Freddy would say, \"Yeah Baby!\"",

They're known for getting their patrons in and out of the store within ten seconds, and for selling hundreds of pies a day. And they're certainly not the only people in the dollar-slice game in New York City.  Ever since the Great Recession in 2008, dollar-slice spots started popping up all over Manhattan because people were in desperate need of a quick and cheap food option. Now there are more than 80 dollar-slice spots on the streets of New York. People gravitate to dollar slice because it's quick, easy, cheap, filling—and the slices themselves are pretty damn good considering the price.  But, according to pizza historian Scott Wiener, dollar slices may be on the way out...so get them while you can!",

Angel also makes Puerto Rican classics like beef pastelitos and shrimp mofongo.  La Piraña Lechonera is only open on the weekends, as Angel works a day job fixing air conditioning units. Originally from Aguadilla, Puerto Rico, Angel immigrated to the United States as a teenager. Now, he’s a legend of his community.",
