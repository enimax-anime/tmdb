To win the race, the score leading team members must also drive the vehicle to Vegas, and cross the finish line at the Flamingo hotel.

A bunch of cars have been strewn down a track. The team that has the fastest total time after 3 runs (and a different driver each time) through the cars will advance. However, if they go outside of the yellow boundaries on the sides of the track, they incur a ten second penalty. So it isn't just speed...it's precision as well.\n\n For the High Flyers, it's all about the traction. Using a monsterous truck for a base, they will add a second axle to the rear and wrap the two tires with tank treads. Combine a big engine and those massive footprints and put a big plow on the front and you have a bulldozer...in essence. However, adding a second axel isn't exactly a walk in the park. Neither will finding a big, reliable engine? This machine will have to be just plain tough!\n\n The Big Shots are going for power. A big truck chassis and a big engine will give them lots of power and strength to withstand any major collisions. However, their plow is going to resemble a cow catcher (like you used to see on old time locomotives). The trick is that they will put their blade at the rear and drive in reverse. This will protect the engine and give them some low-range power. Again, finding a good engine might be the problem.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":10,"show_id":27211,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2003-04-02","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":681525,"name":"Jet Trikes","overview":"It will be a hot time in the junkyard this episode as the Auto Amigos take on the Dirty Drivers in a fast and furious challenge to build a trike powered by a jet-engine. The race will consist of three trips down a one-eighth mile track...one at a time. The team that records the fastest time in any of their three trips will advance to the semi-finals.\n\n The Dirty Drivers are building a true jet engine on a lightweight frame. A propane tank will provide the gas and a spark plug will act as the ignition source. The key ingredient will be a turbo-charger from a truck. The turbo charger has two fans that turn in opposite directions. One fan will suck the propane into a combustion tank while the other will suck the heated air out and through a nozzle. If there's time, they also want to build an afterburner which should increase their speed. An afterburner ignites any remaining gasses in the chamber for added thrust. Time is NOT on their side.\n\n The Auto Amigos, on the other hand, are going for a thermo-jet engine. A car engine will be attached to a large fan. The fan will suck air into a large tube which will be funneled out the back. Around the back side of the fan are a series of nozzles which will spray a mist of gasoline into the tube. A spark plug will ignite the propane causing a jet of hot air (and flames) to shoot out the back. This is going to be heavy so a big, beefy, sturdy frame will be necessary.
