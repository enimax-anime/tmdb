When Sir Roger threatens to end their careers, because he felt betrayed, he's killed.  A short while after, his butler figures out the motives for his master's murder, and blackmails the actors, who have no other choice than to kill him and make it look like he commited suicide due to remorse, because he murdered his employer.
