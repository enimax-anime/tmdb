Sissi, meanwhile, plants a tracking device on Ulrich in order to discover their secret. When it comes time to shut down the supercomputer, all but Yumi are unwilling to go through with it: Aelita is still holding onto the hope that her father can somehow be saved, Jeremie doesn't want to take away the thing which made them friends, and Odd and Ulrich both liked being heroes. While they muse over their attachments to Lyoko, Sissi finds her way into the computer lab, and Jeremie's open diary reveals the whole of their adventures. When Sissi tries to explain this to her father, he believes she has lost it and sends her to the infirmary. A return to the past deals with that problem. Ulrich stops Sissi from planting the tracker on the repeat attempt, and the quintet invites her as a friend. Once more at the supercomputer, the group unanimously decides to shut it down, closing the book on their adventures, for now.","vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"air_date":"2007-11-10","episode_number":30,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":23,"season_number":4,"show_id":4622,"still_path":"/bEtWAiO4pbumT5dDxpS342uhhi6.jpg"},"name":"Code Lyoko","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":249,"logo_path":"/1ePfTUHHvBlVQxa0Fltx5kWhIs5.png","name":"France 3","origin_country":"FR"}],"number_of_episodes":95,"number_of_seasons":4,"origin_country":["FR"],"original_language":"fr","original_name":"Code Lyoko","overview":"Code Lyoko centers on four children who travel to the virtual world of Lyoko to battle against a sentient artificial intelligence named XANA, with a virtual human called Aelita.","popularity":18.782,"poster_path":"/86LdmxBCP9ghdtATP4WjN29vSqP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":62041,"logo_path":"/bpwbP4LWzTGOYrGciytKcAaeW5X.png","name":"MoonScoop","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":130265,"logo_path":"/j1T7FkYoncVpTi3CylwiiBPvRwV.png","name":"Antefilms Production","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2001-06-04","episode_count":3,"id":14118,"name":"Specials","overview":"First episode where they discover the factory.","poster_path":"/aSj7md7mtEcBCKYvojmWiMQYPMg.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2003-09-03","episode_count":26,"id":14113,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/mv0mbvBh9LHMzKl8UdorwM9M1xM.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":9.3},{"air_date":"2005-08-31","episode_count":26,"id":14114,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/kZrWH0suHet8XfWk1nqcrc4tegi.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":9.3},{"air_date":"2006-09-09","episode_count":13,"id":14115,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/8VtS52DUmq2neijF1xqmqJHUvhK.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":9.2},{"air_date":"2007-08-13","episode_count":30,"id":14116,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/3ag8kIlGz4nhbRlHtPAGZdrbUFd.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":9.3}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Fran√ßais"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.225,"vote_count":51,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5257772e760ee36aaa539785","air_date":"2003-09-03","episodes":[{"air_date":"2003-09-03","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":335326,"name":"Teddygozilla","overview":"A student named Milly seeks the comfort of her teddy bear after being embarrassed and ostracized due to her young age by Sissi, the school's bully/diva.

Aelita is not willing to go, angry over the fact that Hopper had essentially taken her life from her. She's also worried that Xana might escape. To that end, she shuts down the supercomputer. Jeremie rescues her, and the group goes to Lyoko to retrieve her fragment. After all their efforts, they seem to succeed, but it turns out to be a fake. Xana manages to devirtualize Aelita's defenders and steal her memory, effectively killing her and allowing him to escape, which shuts down Lyoko in the process. His escape allows Franz Hopper to revive Aelita and Lyoko, restoring all of Aelita's memories in the process. Through the restoration, Aelita finally remembers her past up to the point that she went to Lyoko. With Xana now free and Aelita's memories returned, neither are linked to the supercomputer. This means that they could shut it down, but it would do no good. Unsure of how they'll proceed, Jeremie promises that they'll find a way to stop Xana.","production_code":"","runtime":23,"season_number":2,"show_id":4622,"still_path":"/1QXM3KkTkT189x1EA8abM5ZlrzE.jpg","vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 2","overview":"","id":14114,"poster_path":"/kZrWH0suHet8XfWk1nqcrc4tegi.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":9.3},"3":{"_id":"5257772e760ee36aaa5397ad","air_date":"2006-09-09","episodes":[{"air_date":"2006-09-09","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":335378,"name":"Straight To Heart","overview":"On her way to the forest as part of a science class field trip, Yumi becomes the target of the driver and the passengers on the school bus who all have been possessed by X.A.N.A.

Jeremie uses some new tricks to stop the Kolossus, allowing Aelita and Odd to reach the supercomputer without worry. However, an army of robotic drones now stationed at the facility complicates matters and they de-translated Odd. With much effort, Aelita is able to run the program to free William before she is de-translated also, but their victory comes at a cost: though William is saved, the Skid is destroyed by the Kolossus with Aelita in it.
