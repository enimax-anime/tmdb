His first case is The Ipcress File — a dangerous undercover mission on which Palmer must use his links to a man suspected of kidnapping a missing British nuclear scientist.","production_code":"","runtime":47,"season_number":1,"show_id":114926,"still_path":"/1pemSn7jTK0e0NWaw9a8sIjzMzt.jpg","vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5fde95d897fdec003fbaa4e6","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":63306,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Watkins","original_name":"James Watkins","popularity":2.717,"profile_path":"/ik0bbpMrqAaaJlOYB1DbdslQHwh.jpg"},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"6193ee896ca9a00094183789","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8999,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"John Hodge","original_name":"John Hodge","popularity":3.504,"profile_path":"/hmGIWunWP8pQFqukBt63cjm2udR.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2022-03-13","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":3341245,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"A bomb explodes under Jean's car and only Harry's quick-thinking saves their lives.
