It is home to a thousand years of bloody history and is one of Britain's most iconic landmarks. At almost every chapter in London's history, ‘the Tower’ has had a starring role. Built by William the Conquer as part of the Norman Conquest of England in the 11th century, it was designed to dominate London's skyline. The ancient fortifications are set in grounds the same size as those of the White House, but this is far more than just a castle, protecting London from her enemies.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":62889,"still_path":"/v7OMMvFXonngS9tGBbsfkxl5xEX.jpg","vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5d81cc0b869e75001e0b7c62","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1522882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicky Matthews","original_name":"Vicky Matthews","popularity":1.783,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-05-21","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1072989,"name":"Secrets of Underground London","overview":"On the surface, London is a buzzing metropolis. But underneath lies secret, hidden worlds, all but forgotten by the millions of people above. These places make up the countless layers of London, and each tells a unique story of the city’s past - successes and failures; victories and tragedies. When the Romans founded settlements along the River Thames during the 1st century AD, they laid down the very first layer of one of the world’s greatest cities. Long buried pieces of the original Roman town still survive to this day – statues, walls, even an entire amphitheatre, where fierce gladiators once fought…and died for glory.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":62889,"still_path":"/zFqYPbZeKNZt8c6XahUjnqbpIkx.jpg","vote_average":2,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5d81cc92cabfe4001c8a6e0f","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1807006,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gareth Sacala","original_name":"Gareth Sacala","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5d81cc0b869e75001e0b7c62","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1522882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Vicky Matthews","original_name":"Vicky Matthews","popularity":1.783,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-05-28","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1072990,"name":"Secrets of Westminster","overview":"From the outside, Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament are the classic London scene.
