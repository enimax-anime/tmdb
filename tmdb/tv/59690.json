The techniques involved in creating the iconic dance dress include a tightly fitted bodice and perfect full circle skirt.\n\nNext up, it’s the Transformation Challenge, and just like Julie Andrews's Maria in The Sound of Music, the sewers are asked to adapt old curtains into play clothes for children.\n\nFor their final challenge, the Made to Measure, the sewers take on the disco era with an outfit inspired by the movie Dreamgirls.",
