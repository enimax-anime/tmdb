The Lab  Rats instead believe this to be a trap, leading Donald to activate a new  security system that only he can bypass. While Leo is at Mission Creek  High School, Douglas arrives and tries to appeal to Leo by reminding him  that he knew about Douglas and Marcus before the rest of them. Douglas  then shows Leo video footage of Krane implanting himself with bionics  and asks him to call his brother to prove his honesty. Back at the lab, a  transmission comes in and shows Leo and Tasha captured. While Donald  thinks it's Douglas, Krane reveals himself on-screen as the captor and  demands that the Lab Rats arrive in 10 minutes. While the Lab Rats want  to rescue them, Donald heads out alone with an extremely powerful  thermal blaster. Donald arrives at Krane's lair, only for Krane to  siphon the power from the blaster, rendering it useless and quickly  beating Donald with super strength and molecularkinesis. During the  battle, Leo and Tasha are trapped in an exothermic energy field to fry  them. Afterward, Krane geo-leaps to the lab, allowing Donald to use the  thermal blaster to suck in the heat to set Leo and Tasha free. As Chase  works to deactivate the security system, Krane arrives and easily beats  the Lab Rats with his more advanced bionics. Before Krane can finish  them off, Douglas arrives and blasts Krane with a laser blaster.  Although he saves the Lab Rats, Krane quickly recovers and knocks him  down with another force wave. As he once again prepares to attack, Chase  repels his blast back at him with a force-field, defeating him for  good. Douglas plans to capture the unconscious Krane, but Donald arrives  and blames the entire mess on him. Unfortunately, Krane geo-leaps out  of the house and Donald demands that Douglas leaves.","production_code":"308","runtime":null,"season_number":3,"show_id":38867,"still_path":"/eiFpTw74Z73E4SYIOMbMIKlB0tV.jpg","vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Douglas Davenport","credit_id":"60ea2a80e004a60030760514","order":510,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1192496,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeremy Kent Jackson","original_name":"Jeremy Kent Jackson","popularity":3.496,"profile_path":"/jpVI15LVSS8f7VGDay35mGaxvAR.jpg"},{"character":"Victor Krane","credit_id":"62adf31985702e0062119b1c","order":556,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":92615,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Graham Shiels","original_name":"Graham Shiels","popularity":4.786,"profile_path":"/o0NobGOdnc6LtBo2AjLYUTdby4Q.jpg"},{"character":"Tasha Davenport","credit_id":"627c3732fd4a9600a4c394b5","order":567,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1254399,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Angel Parker","original_name":"Angel Parker","popularity":10.439,"profile_path":"/bbdo6p0rPHQQOp867Uel3Gwfrin.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2014-06-30","episode_number":10,"episode_type":"standard","id":1106097,"name":"Three Minus Bree","overview":"Bree is accepted for a semester abroad program in Australia, but when  Donald learns about it, he refuses to let her go.

At first, Bree relishes  her new freedom and even begins bragging to a disgruntled Leo. During a  mission, Bree feels helpless as Adam and Chase are gone for hours. Chase  reveals that they barely made it out alive and because Bree is no  longer bionic, the mission took twice as long. Bree realizes she was  selfish and apologizes to Adam and Chase. She's ready to become bionic  again, but Donald sadly tells her that since Douglas built the chips, he  isn't sure if Bree will ever be bionic again. Meanwhile, Tasha is sick,  so Leo decides to use his new pill invention on her to see if her  diagnosis will reveal the problem, but when he takes some of the  software from Eddy, Eddy is stuck in Tasha's body.
