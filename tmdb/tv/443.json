Now a busy banquet facility called Hoof, Fin and Feathers, it is the center of mysterious sightings.\n\nA woman in period dress (late 1700s, early 1800s) has been seen in the main house's main dining room. In the bar, people have seen a man dressed in black carrying a book. The most disturbing sighting by far happened in the barn, which is now the banquet hall. There, people have reported seeing a young girl who had been burned.\n\nBoth the cellar and attic inspire feelings of great dread. Several employees have refused to enter them alone. In addition, temperature changes plague the attic. Intense cold will settle onto an extremely concentrated area — someone's face, or even just his or her nose.\n\nOwner and head chef Linda Wadensten does not feel threatened, though she does want TAPS to find what is haunting the Carriage Inn.\n\nThen, TAPS comes to help a military family living in Groton, Conn.\n\nWhen the Stitelers's four-year-old son first saw the ghost of a child in his room, a boy with black hair and black eyes, he didn't tell his parents. Instead, he mentioned it while he was in the hospital with a brief illness. His mother was surprised that he knew what a ghost was, and wrote it off as an imaginary friend until she told her husband. William went white. He had seen the same figure in their home, and it had terrified him.\n\nIn addition, the husband has had a sleeping problem in recent months.

Because the tragedy occurred on a large naval base, the team is only asked to investigate the Main hanger, which is known as the hub for paranormal activity.\n\nAnd in case you've never heard of Hindenburg, here's a little history lesson for you: The Hindenburg was a German airship filled with hydrogen for buoyancy. In 1937, while trying to dock at the Lakehurst Naval base, it caught fire and killed 36 people. The entire ordeal was caught on film and is still one of the most famous tragedies that has ever been reported. To date, people on the base claim: they've seen shadows, been touched by invisible forces and heard doors slam by themselves. Sounds like paranormals to us, but TAPS heads in to give the official word.\n\nAfter taking a tour of the massive base, the ghost hunters get to work. Jay and Grant begin the hunt on the main floor of Hangar 1. They hear loud humming noises but realize that they are in the middle of a huge building so they attribute the sounds to the size of the space. They have another false alarm when a figure is picked up on the thermal imaging camera that looks like a person under a white sheet. Upon further investigation they see that the \"figure\" is merely military equipment that looks like a human form from a distance. But later on they do see an actual figure running up the stairwell. Hoping to catch whatever was running from them, each of the investigators walk up the catwalk.\n\nMeanwhile hunters Kris and Amy co-investigate the medical facilities area where people claim they've seen paranormals. While there, two lights in the building turn on and off by themselves and neither of the hunters can figure out if the issue is electrical or paranormal.\n\nToward the end of the investigation, Amy and Kris survey the abandoned office area of Hanger one. While the ghost hunters are there, a door closes, the light goes out in the stairwell and the sound of a man grunting is echoed in the space. Seems like the girls have company after all. But when Dustin and Britt investigate that same area they don't have any experiences. So they leave the digital recorder running to catch any anomalies that may occur while they're away.\n\nThen Jason and Grant review the basement area and are hit with a harsh odor. They find that the floor drain is allowing sewer gas to seep back into the building as steam so they pour water down the drain to prevent the steam from rising. Fortunately their knowledge as plumbers helped them solve what could potentially be a dangerous problem for other people entering the basement. When Dustin and Britt head to this area, they notice that the electromagnetic fields in the corner are extremely high. They believe that this may be why people get feelings of paranoia while in the area. Although this explanation is trumped when Dustin feels something brush against his hair.\n\nWhen Jason and Grant investigate the actual crash site they don't spot any instances of paranormal activity and feel that of all the areas in Hangar 1, this one, ironically is the least eerie. After reviewing all of the evidence gathered during the hunt and critically analyzing each of the hunter's experiences, TAPS concludes that there is paranormal activity occurring within the Hindenburg site. Were you surprised?\n\n\t\t  \t\n\n\t\n\ngh Video\n\nGhost Hunters - Christmas Eve Marathon","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":5,"show_id":443,"still_path":"/2kDJua1PN6GVCVqofsnZzdNJa3S.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 5","overview":"","id":1291,"poster_path":"/vSAZ7j6LsXseqlAuHd566hyYklG.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":10},"6":{"_id":"5253577519c295794014e702","air_date":"2010-03-03","episodes":[{"air_date":"2010-03-03","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":22452,"name":"Alcatraz Live","overview":"San Francisco, CA - Alcatraz Island (2-hour, season premiere hosted by Josh Gates of Destination Truth; TAPS reviews their 100th televised investigation before a live, studio audience at 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City).","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":6,"show_id":443,"still_path":"/f0hl9X1yIE5OuN3ZIymZoyQ3xih.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"5d7f18eb3c43440010a2dac3","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2006783,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Barry Fitzgerald","original_name":"Barry Fitzgerald","popularity":1.891,"profile_path":"/3JGBOJq5cnPQgtptlHf41hgzb94.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2010-03-10","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":22338,"name":"Fort Ticonderoga","overview":"An 18th Century fort haunted by the dead of three nations needs help from the TAPS team, and the Ghost Hunters are thrilled to oblige.\n\nFort Ticonderoga has it all: voices from apparitions speaking in French and English, lights flashing, drums and bagpipes playing and even horses stomping.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":6,"show_id":443,"still_path":"/1hqw5pEUT1AkewoWubbrBDIuW89.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-03-17","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":22453,"name":"Shamrock Spirits","overview":"At Paddy Reilly's Bar in New York City, claims are that the activity is as hot after hours as it is when the bands are playing.

This is going to be good! Employees at the Old State Capital Building in Baton Rouge, Louisiana are tired of encountering spirits and have asked TAPS to check out the activity like shadows, noises and voices. Many suspect the soul of Pierre Couvillan, who died in the building after a heated debate over gambling. Tom Clarke, the client and distant relative of congressman Couvillan, has been physically bumped by an invisible entity. Also, the building was once a prison for Union soldiers during the Civil War so those spirits could well be present too. Steve and Jay aren't 10 seconds into the investigation when a door slams and they hear footsteps running away from them! They capture footsteps on the recorder as well! Meanwhile, Amy and Adam play blackjack even though they don't know how, in hopes of drawing out Couvillan. They get a series of noises in response, so the strategy worked! Then the two see a shadow move across the doorway in the basement and hear a voice. This place is actually a little scary! STOP: All teams hear a crazy squealing sound at the same time! What was that?! At the end of the investigation, the team has lots of personal activity and recorded evidence of the paranormal. They cannot confirm that it's Couvillan, but at least the employees know they're not crazy! Next, the Magnolia Plantation in Charleston, S.C. is one of the most haunted locations in the country. The team has been asked to determine if the paranormal activity on the plantation are the ghosts of the Drayton Family, which has owned the property since the 1600s. One distant uncle was accidentally shot while hunting and died on the front porch- could it be him? People have seen an apparition and a one-handed broken clock has suddenly chimed for no reason. Hopefully, the team can offer scientific evidence to back the claims. And if they are able to find evidence, Taylor Drayton will be very pleased. By the way, look out for alligators feeding at night…because ghosts aren't frightening enough. The team has plenty of personal experiences including a coughing noise and a voice caught on Steve and Jason's recorder. While Jason brings the recorder to the van for analysis, Steve hears strange shuffling noises. Amy and Adam hear a piano playing and a little girl's voice. Later the guys hear music, but can't figure out where it's coming from. Then BAM the curtains fall on Steve's head!! Cue the impromptu golf cart race to blow off some steam at the end of the night!

Back in the 1920s, this theater hosted famous entertainers and vaudeville stars. But today's unseen visitors are stealing the show! People have been touched, seen objects moved and heard a child's laughter when no child was present. In the 1930s, a little boy named Kevin was hit by a car in front of the theater, and many believe his is the ghost that haunts the historic site. His shadow has been spotted several times and visitors even tried to have him removed from an all-girl's party! One child even reported playing with a little boy named Kevin, when there were no other children there. Whoa. And Kevin is not alone! There's a woman in white who haunts the balcony and plays the organ. TAPS is on call to help sort out these spirits and make employees feel safe at work. Side note! Amy is on maternity leave, which means she can't help out in this huge building. Jason's daughter Haylee is on site, with KJ and newbie Ashley to help pick up the slack. The investigation turns up some interesting results. Steve is freaked out by a moving shadow, but it can't be seen on the big screen. KJ and Britt chase shadows in the coatroom, and they both see what COULD BE the lady in white on the balcony. WOW. In the star's dressing room, Steve and Jason find that the EMF levels are at dangerously high levels. The room is so unsafe that it's messing up their monitors! The high levels could give power to the spirits, but it could also make people hallucinate and feel extremely uncomfortable. In the auditorium Ashley and Adam see a shadow running around the aisles, it's small. Is it Kevin?! Meanwile Tango and Steve see the shadow shaped like a woman in the rotunda.

Actually, this time Hollywood is cheering for TAPS as they come in to solve some age-old mysteries in famed haunted locations. The season 9 opener starts at The Sowden House. This is the site of the Black Dalia murder. They meet Steve Hodell, whose surgeon father was the original suspect in the vicious attack. This is L.A.'s most infamous murder, where Elizabeth Short was surgically cut in half, and both halves were carefully posed on the side of the road. George believes his father murdered 9 other women in the basement. His sister, Rita, saw apparitions in the basement. Rita's experiences include seeing shadows in the night, hearing voices and other strange sounds- including chains being dragged. Everyone wants to know who these spirits are and what they want. An intensely personal request, which is what TAPS does best. Big news!! Michelle Tate, runner up from Ghost Hunters academy, is now joining the team. Everyone is excited to see her, and Jason reminds her that professionalism is key, and she needs to remember that not every noise is paranormal. During the investigation, K.J. and Britt monitor the cameras and notice a figure walking halfway across the room and then returning to the bathroom that was likely the murder scene. What is that?? It looks like half a human being, and Elizabeth Short was cut in half! Jason believes that whether the ghost haunting the house is the spirit of George Hodell or one of his victims, they would be more apt to reach out to Michelle. So she's alone in the bathroom, and hears footsteps and pacing. In the basement, K.J. and Britt mix the shadow detector and the laser grid technologies. They see odd movements and hear strange noises. Later, Michelle and Adam hear a woman's voice in the hallway. Analysis revealed that the footsteps Michelle heard in the bathroom were from someone outside, and the figure that Britt and K.J. saw turned out to be a crew member. Bummer! That would have been awesome evidence! However, the team managed to catch a recording of a child's voice saying \"It's George and Charles\", and another voice saying \"Did you even know my name?\" Rita feels validated about her feelings about her childhood home. TAPS help another client! Next: Madame Tussauds' Wax Museum. With the famous wax figures come frightening stories! What a freaky place to investigate! The client, John, says employees hear music after hours and the presence of someone with them. Employees claim Bette Davis' eyes move, and see figures (not even wax ones), and a sign turns on and off. Victor Killian, an actor, was beaten to death nearby. Is his ghost haunting the museum? Or are the wax figures just freaking people out? Britt and K.J. pick up crazy EMF readings, while Jason and Steve hear humming on the second floor. Wait a minute, Steve realizes it could be a backdraft in the elevator. Tango and Adam hear strange sounds, but when they investigate some mysterious shadow movements they realize blinking lights are the culprit- not ghosts! Debunked! Evidence analysis showed strange noises the team recorded, and convincing video of a figure crossing the Bette Davis Room. Jason tells John, the client, that this looks to be paranormal. But there's no way to confirm whether or not it is Victor Killian.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":9,"show_id":443,"still_path":"/wzfpz65k5CzAbanljR7KQNhB6cf.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"61d7622f6350130043c1f9a0","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3372139,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John R.

Tonight TAPS returns to the Bluegrass State to investigate The Belle of Louisville, the oldest operating steamboat in America. The beautiful and colorful exterior of this vessel isn't enough to cover up the ship's history of rumors, mystery and murder! Captain Winters, the longtime head of the steamboat, was not a nice guy. Apparently he sent one of his mates, Floyd, to the paddle wheel and then turned it on, killing Floyd! Winters later died on the ship of a heart attack. Mark Doty, the current captain, is skeptical of paranormal claims. But his crew has seen more than their share of activity. Shadow figures, moving blue lights, voices, whispering, doors swinging and even a face-to-face encounter with the ghost of Captain Winters! The crew is freaked out by the increasing intensity of the experiences, and suspect that the activity has moved to the neighboring lifesaving station as well. Captain Doty would like TAPS to put his night watchmen at ease. During the investigation, Britt and Michelle conclude that high EMF levels may be serving as a conduit for the spirits moving between the two ships. Jason and Steve chase footsteps from the boiler room to the ballroom to the gangway, but can't find the source. A mysterious swinging door catches Tango and Michelle's attention, but it turns out the wind is the culprit. Jason and Steve continue to chase Floyd on the neighboring ship, but determine that the high EMF levels on that ship could be causing the crew to misguidedly perceive paranormal activity. On the main deck, Britt and Adam see a large black shadow just where the ship crew claims to see figures, and they can't debunk it. Britt and Adam experience shuffling footsteps and flashing lights in the life saving station and continue to hear unusual noises. In the captain's quarters, they have shocking conversation with Captain Winters. Michelle and Britt then have a conversation with Floyd in the lifesaving station using a REM-pod. While a lot of claims were debunked in this investigation, during the analysis the team discovers recording of voices that weren't detected.
