Reagan starts off the auditions and gets four yes votes and the first apron of the night. Austyn is up next but gets two immediate no votes, so she fails. Kendal is next and gets four yes votes for the evening's second apron. Jessica attempts her audition next but she gets two no votes and does not pass. Michele follows with her audition and also gets two no votes thus failing. Jennifer is next and gets three yes votes, breaking the streak of failures and earning the night's third apron. Sav follows with her audition and gets an overwhelming four yes votes and the fourth apron. When Kolby auditions, Gordon brings his grandfather in to taste the dish and witness Kolby being awarded the fifth and final apron.",
