He's the repairman called in to fix the bar tap. Although Don is not Rebecca's usual type, Frasier talks her into taking a chance when she states that someone like a Don is what she should be going after. Quickly, she falls head over heals, but Sam thinks she's settling for second best. He wants Rebecca to be his fall-back if in a couple of years he has not found \"Mrs. Malone\". Rebecca shoots back that he is an aging Lothario way past his prime. Frasier suggests to Sam, who is hurt by Rebecca's comments, that perhaps there is some truth to Rebecca's assertion about him and that he would benefit by group therapy for sexual compulsives. Sam does go to the meeting, and after a rough start, he does admit that perhaps he is no longer happy with his life.","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":11,"show_id":141,"still_path":"/mFk6wQ0cKjdvQ43qmA3n33xLBmg.jpg","vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52533e0819c29579400813e7","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":157437,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Burrows","original_name":"James Burrows","popularity":4.623,"profile_path":"/b2hSq8OclJZdglNFM1Txaz5uBgs.jpg"},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"52533e1419c295794008182c","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213757,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Angell","original_name":"David Angell","popularity":0.7,"profile_path":"/hVy0K1BJismmv5EG3aEO4HoepR3.jpg"},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"52533e0d19c2957940081549","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213753,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Casey","original_name":"Peter Casey","popularity":1.712,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5655910c925141019b002d89","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212926,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Clark Lee","original_name":"David Clark Lee","popularity":2.86,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"52533e0419c29579400812f5","order":529,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7090,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelsey Grammer","original_name":"Kelsey Grammer","popularity":30.36,"profile_path":"/cjUCogoFRnFKAgeyRmGGpekz0TF.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1993-05-20","episode_number":26,"episode_type":"standard","id":7861,"name":"One for the Road (1)","overview":"Whilst watching the National Cable Ace Awards, the gang sees ex-waitress Diane Chambers winning the award for best writing in a mini-series.
