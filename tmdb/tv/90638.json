Sent to Joybuster, a game company on the brink of bankruptcy, Dan-Te takes on the role of CEO and wastes no time in trying to get this company back on its feet.\n\nAs head of game development at Joybuster, Shin Yeon-Hwa teams up with her new CEO, in an attempt to save their dying company. Tasked with developing a new game which satisfies all of Dan-Te’s demands, Yeon-Hwa soon finds herself wavering somewhere between having a nervous breakdown and committing murder.\n\nCompletely at odds with each other, Yeon-Hwa and Dan-Te never seem to stop fighting; but everyone knows opposites always find a way to attract. Can the poker-faced boss with zero emotions and the hot-tempered game developer really find love when they can’t even agree on a way to save their dying company?","popularity":4.895,"poster_path":"/1dSIcLMIZFT0XnkoGOSDhcbj89.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2019-07-10","episode_count":12,"id":126665,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":8,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5d11f806c3a368546e1ea74e","air_date":"2019-07-10","episodes":[{"air_date":"2019-07-10","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1836149,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":90638,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-07-11","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1836150,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":90638,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-07-17","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1855018,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":90638,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-07-18","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":1855019,"name":"Episode 4","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":90638,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-07-24","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":1855020,"name":"Episode 5","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":90638,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-07-25","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":1855021,"name":"Episode 6","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":90638,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-07-31","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":1855022,"name":"Episode 7","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":90638,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-08-01","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"standard","id":1855023,"name":"Episode 8","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":90638,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-08-07","episode_number":9,"episode_type":"standard","id":1855024,"name":"Episode 9","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":90638,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-08-08","episode_number":10,"episode_type":"standard","id":1855025,"name":"Episode 10","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":90638,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-08-14","episode_number":11,"episode_type":"standard","id":1855026,"name":"Episode 11","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":90638,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-08-15","episode_number":12,"episode_type":"finale","id":1855027,"name":"Episode 12","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":90638,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":126665,"poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
