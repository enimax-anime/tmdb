When she walks away, Kelly Ellard and Warren Glowatski follow her, beat her again and drown her. They are arrested a week later by Saanich Police. The unfolding coverage shocks the country due to the senseless violence of the young crowd. Almost ten years later, Kelly Ellard was convicted of second-degree murder, ending one of the most tragic chapters in Canadian history.",
