Eventually, the two families lose contact with each other, because soon after the contract is signed, Jung Sook's family encounters financial issues and is forced to run away.\n\n18 years later, Jung Sook has grown up to be a rebellious and strong-willed girl who just wants to live her life as she sees fit. With little aspirations, she is the direct foil of her achievement-bound counterpart, Hyuk Joon. When the two meet again, they clash horribly; Jung Sook thinks her fiancee is nothing but boring, and Hyuk Joon believes Jung Sook to be nothing but an immature child. Despite this, they marry. What follows is the story of their new life living together as a couple, and the obstacles they are faced with.","popularity":3.487,"poster_path":"/cOPXxP3GoFOQlLFOgJ1nYXKlNfc.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2004-01-19","episode_count":16,"id":25327,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Mandarin","iso_639_1":"zh","name":"普通话"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":6,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52582dc7760ee36aaa8ac3f1","air_date":"2004-01-19","episodes":[{"air_date":"2004-01-19","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":512388,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-01-19","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":512389,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-01-26","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":512390,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-01-27","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":512391,"name":"Episode 4","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-02-02","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":512392,"name":"Episode 5","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-02-03","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":512393,"name":"Episode 6","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-02-09","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":512394,"name":"Episode 7","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-02-10","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"standard","id":512395,"name":"Episode 8","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-02-16","episode_number":9,"episode_type":"standard","id":512396,"name":"Episode 9","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-02-17","episode_number":10,"episode_type":"standard","id":512397,"name":"Episode 10","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-02-23","episode_number":11,"episode_type":"standard","id":512398,"name":"Episode 11","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-02-24","episode_number":12,"episode_type":"standard","id":512399,"name":"Episode 12","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-03-01","episode_number":13,"episode_type":"standard","id":512400,"name":"Episode 13","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-03-02","episode_number":14,"episode_type":"standard","id":512401,"name":"Episode 14","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-03-08","episode_number":15,"episode_type":"standard","id":512402,"name":"Episode 15","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-03-09","episode_number":16,"episode_type":"finale","id":512403,"name":"Episode 16","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":14023,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":25327,"poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
