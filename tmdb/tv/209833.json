What she didn't realize is this tall boy in front of her was the little boy that used to hide behind her, and just treated him like a stranger. Later on, Ji Qiu's team's new variety show \"Let's Meet Now\" gave the two an opportunity to interact in their work and life, and this pair of love-hate couple gradually get to know each other more. This drama takes a variety show \"Let's Meet Now\" as its entry point, and uses the reunion of a pair of childhood friends as a clue to build a wonderful modern love story.",

What she didn't realize is this tall boy in front of her was the little boy that used to hide behind her, and just treated him like a stranger. Later on, Ji Qiu's team's new variety show \"Let's Meet Now\" gave the two an opportunity to interact in their work and life, and this pair of love-hate couple gradually get to know each other more. This drama takes a variety show \"Let's Meet Now\" as its entry point, and uses the reunion of a pair of childhood friends as a clue to build a wonderful modern love story.",
