Fragments from the asteroid, and even from the moon itself, penetrate Earth's atmosphere and make impact. Even though the initial damage is minimal, nerves are frayed throughout the planet. There is significant physical damage to the lunar surface, but experts quickly conclude there will be no lasting ramifications. Then strange anomalies begin to manifest themselves on Earth.","production_code":"","runtime":91,"season_number":1,"show_id":31756,"still_path":"/veXD6qJ5dLrIFNIe4DknkOxwDdq.jpg","vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5258a041760ee3466164716b","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":182892,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mike Rohl","original_name":"Mike Rohl","popularity":1.95,"profile_path":"/6MFWkS5rVa8NSh9gW9kYMLlkxmV.jpg"},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"55fe6aa4c3a368132c002e01","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":150953,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Michael Vickerman","original_name":"Michael Vickerman","popularity":4.126,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Casting","department":"Production","credit_id":"55fe6acfc3a3681330002d96","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":63784,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Candice Elzinga","original_name":"Candice Elzinga","popularity":2.83,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"55fe6abc92514104710003d3","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1391803,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Ted Bauman","original_name":"Ted Bauman","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2009-02-15","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"finale","id":760371,"name":"Part 2","overview":"Alex, Maddie, Roland and the rest of their team soon discover something far worse - the moon's new orbit has put it on a collision course with Earth!
