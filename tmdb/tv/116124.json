Spanning 70 years, videos range from a bizarre shape caught on camera during a 1950s minor league baseball game, to new videos leaked in 2021 of pyramids apparently stalking US warships, to a UFO that seemingly dives into the ocean and disappears. Harris and a collection of top experts, from national security specialists to physicists, evaluate each video or film. In 2021. a us government report on UFOs made international headlines by admitting UFOs are real. but the big question remains: What are these incredible objects seen throughout history and around the world? This super-sized episode features videos and films deemed highly credible, and now analyzed for the first time.",
