The Argo (with Wildstar and Homer) is returning from remote patrol duty in the solar system. On the way back to Earth, the Argo receives an encoded message amidst a huge electromagnetic power surge. It is not yet known whether the surge was used to send the message, or to jam it, or for some other purpose.\n\nDuring the surge, the Argo is attacked by an unidentified squadron of fighter planes.

The Andromeda and other ships have skeleton crews, with most of the central systems controlled by computer. Sandor laments this since he believes that \"we must keep control of the machines we create. If we don't, we're doomed.\" (see episode 1-18).\n\nThere are improvements for the Argo too: New shock cannons that have an increased range (150% of the original); and, a time radar that is capable to detecting past events in space. Sandor demonstrates it for Wildstar by showing Chief Engineer Orion urinating against a ship-yard wall. Must be getting old, that one.\n\nBut, all the improvements are not welcome. Sandor reveals to Wildstar that Earth Defense Committee wants the Argo to be adapted to the same kind of computer control system a la Andromeda. Derek flies into a rage and storms off to the Commander's office in protest. He urges, \"The Argo's heart and blood is the Star Force. It's people, not machinery!\"\n\nWhile pleading his case to the Commander, as if in symmetry to the recent power surge, there is a power blackout over most of Earth, which is an attempt by the new enemy to soften up Earth defenses. During the outage, Wildstar spots an alien spy plane (a horseshoe crab-shaped bomber) flying over the darkened city.\n\nSandor notices a huge comet in the distant sky heading towards Earth.
