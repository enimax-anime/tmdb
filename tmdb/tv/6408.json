Justin has to secure interviews and appearances with the stars of the show who have not spoken to each other for some time.\n\nJustin met with the below people to discuss the show and asked them to attend a reunion. All of them bar Mr. T made it to the meeting, which took place at the Friars Club of Beverly Hills.\n\n    * Dirk Benedict - Templeton \"Faceman\" Peck\n\n    * Dwight Schultz - H.M. \"Howling Mad\" Murdock\n\n    * Marla Heasley - Tawnia Baker\n\n    * Jack Ging - General Harlan \"Bull\" Fullbright\n\n    * Mr. T - B.A. Baracus\n\n    * Stephen Cannell - series co-creator\n\nThe below people although not being interviewed by Justin appeared at the meeting.\n\n    * William Lucking - Colonel Lynch\n\n    * Lance LeGault - Colonel Roderick Decker\n\n    * Christian Peppard - Representing his late father George Peppard\n\nJustin often used very unorthodox methods, such as ambushing the actors in their homes, hotel rooms, or even while out shopping, without any prior warning and, for Mr. T, attempting to gatecrash his way into the Latin Grammy Awards.\n\nDuring every interview, Collins would inquire about the rumored tension between Peppard and Mr T. Although Peppard was an established star of Hollywood movies, Mr. T was relatively new to on-screen acting yet, in a short time, he was generally regarded as the main star of the show. It was suggested that tension did indeed exist between the two and was most probably due to Peppard's bitterness of Mr. T's status in the show. During the interview with Mr. T, the trademark gold chains worn by his character were discussed. Mr. T stated that they were symbolic of the iron chains of his African slave-ancestors but made from gold because he thinks of himself as being a 'slave' except with a higher price now. As a lighthearted joke for the show, a medium attempted to contact the deceased George Peppard via seance.\n\nThe program never touched upon the fifth season of the series in any way, with no mention of Eddie Velez and Robert Vaughn's characters, and neither actor appearing at the reunion itself. Additionally, the episode in which Jack Ging's character General Fullbright is shot and killed is specifically described as the series' final episode (it was in fact, the final episode of season four).","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":6408,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Self - B.A. Baracus","credit_id":"52578638760ee36aaa636a11","order":504,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mr. T","original_name":"Mr. T","popularity":16.76,"profile_path":"/oblysKmIpP7fg5iW5P212s8LGAg.jpg"},{"character":"Self - H.M. \"Howling Mad\" Murdock","credit_id":"52578638760ee36aaa636a23","order":509,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":28248,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dwight Schultz","original_name":"Dwight Schultz","popularity":16.354,"profile_path":"/kVXkC94gNdSWRvDAs0DqBCduJ4S.jpg"},{"character":"Self - Templeton \"Faceman\" Peck","credit_id":"52578638760ee36aaa636a35","order":516,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58264,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dirk Benedict","original_name":"Dirk Benedict","popularity":17.415,"profile_path":"/lQG0YpiHdhQgs5DKS0185JA60mr.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2006-06-06","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":375131,"name":"Bring Back The One-Hit Wonders","overview":"JLC attempts to reunite former pop artists from past decades who have only had one big, well known hit, to play at a one off gig.
