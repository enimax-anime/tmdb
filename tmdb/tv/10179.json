Over 600 candidates with dreams of making the 2010-2011 DCC team arrive before sunrise for the preliminaries. Only 96 ladies will be invited to the semifinal round. At semis the following morning, the candidates are expected to learn an intense and intricate DCC combination and the world-renowned DCC kick-line choreography in under an hour -- and then, exhausted and nervous, perform both dances in front of the judges. The intensity of the competition comes to an end when 47 girls are invited to join 27 returning DCC veterans at the finals auditions.",
