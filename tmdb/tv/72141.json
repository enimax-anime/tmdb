Dre's fortunes turned when Jimmy turned him on to the music of an unknown white rapper named Eminem; with Dre producing, Eminem and Aftermath recorded The Slim Shady LP and took the rap music world by storm. On a roll with Dre and an enviable list of hot new acts, Jimmy was nevertheless worried that the music bubble would burst due to the emergence of Napster, and looked to forge corporate-marketing partnerships to boost the visibility and incomes of his artists. An opportune sit-down between Jimmy and Dre led to the idea of Beats Electronics, the speaker-headphone phenomenon that vaulted the partners to new heights, and paved the way for an historic 2014 deal with Apple. The world's most valuable company wasn't just interested in headphones: it was investing in the genius of Jimmy and Dre, who continue to innovate at Apple Music while picking up accolades--Dre was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with N.W.A. last year--and giving back to the communities that fostered their unique talents.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"2017-07-12","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":59,"season_number":1,"show_id":72141,"still_path":"/5DNpnPVtrvhMvlwFRVVnMKYSbGK.jpg"},"name":"The Defiant Ones","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":49,"logo_path":"/tuomPhY2UtuPTqqFnKMVHvSb724.png","name":"HBO","origin_country":"US"}],"number_of_episodes":4,"number_of_seasons":1,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"The Defiant Ones","overview":"A four-part documentary series that tells the stories of Jimmy Iovine and Dr. Dre -- one the son of a Brooklyn longshoreman, the other straight out of Comptonâ€Š- -- and their improbable partnership and surprising leading roles in a series of transformative events in contemporary culture.","popularity":8.868,"poster_path":"/38JFkjD3SZvbDKvgDEXPUXbK5d0.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2017-07-09","episode_count":4,"id":89142,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/38JFkjD3SZvbDKvgDEXPUXbK5d0.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":62,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5938bbc99251410895006c3f","air_date":"2017-07-09","episodes":[{"air_date":"2017-07-09","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1325540,"name":"Part 1","overview":"Years before they brokered one of the biggest deals in music history--the 2015 sale of Beats Electronics to Apple for $3 billion--Dr. Dre and Jimmy Iovine navigated very different environments towards destinies that would, ultimately and improbably, bring them together. Dre's story began in Compton, CA, where his fascination with dance music, DJ innovations and sound brought him into contact with Eazy-E, Ice Cube, DJ Yella and MC Ren. Together, they would become the core of the 1980s gangsta-rap supergroup N.W.A. A native of Red Hook, Brooklyn, Jimmy gravitated to music following an indifferent academic career, and with a determination to avoid continuing in the family business as a longshoreman, he turned stints answering phones in recording studios to connecting with artists like John Lennon, Patti Smith and Bruce Springsteen through a combination of hard work and old-fashioned luck, eventually building a reputation as a fearless, talented, indefatigable producer.","production_code":"","runtime":54,"season_number":1,"show_id":72141,"still_path":"/bMc9xliFoVFDspzkSd7gljXQifE.jpg","vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ec2b95ecdf2e60022513e7d","order":501,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2273033,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Alonzo

Griffey. Blown away by Dre's singular talent, Jimmy cut a deal with Death Row for Interscope to become the label's distributor. The Chronic became a huge hit and spawned an ever bigger LP from Dre's protege, Snoop Dogg. But hostility was mounting across America towards the misunderstood violent influence of rap music, and Interscope and Time Warner (which owned 25% of the company) found themselves in the crosshairs of an angry political mainstream. As Jimmy resisted overtures to sell Interscope's stake in Death Row, Dre, along with Snoop Dogg and recent signee Tupac Shakur, became embroiled in a violent feud with East Coast rap rivals, notably Sean \"Puffy\" Combs and his Bad Boy Records, which drove Dre to seek out another new beginning.","production_code":"","runtime":81,"season_number":1,"show_id":72141,"still_path":"/22nZEXqMX1SjqQiVZkKQzGxH0hq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"David Kenner","credit_id":"5ec2ba1bd2147c0022b561d6","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1842234,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mark Anthony Petrucelli","original_name":"Mark Anthony Petrucelli","popularity":0.84,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Self (archive footage)","credit_id":"5ec2ba30d2147c0022b561e2","order":504,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54422,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tupac Shakur","original_name":"Tupac Shakur","popularity":18.586,"profile_path":"/tasKybiACxAkc6eykxrL005XPRQ.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ec2b936d2147c0023b7f8a3","order":505,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3186,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Trent Reznor","original_name":"Trent Reznor","popularity":3.013,"profile_path":"/gzvgK9ydCfW5Sh9tsEeYcYCnxrh.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ec55c3a140bad001d17a6de","order":514,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1849298,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Allen J.

Death Row Records to form a subsidiary of Interscope called Aftermath Entertainment, Dre endured a string of disappointing solo releases, but Jimmy stood by him as others argued he should be dropped. Dre's fortunes turned when Jimmy turned him on to the music of an unknown white rapper named Eminem; with Dre producing, Eminem and Aftermath recorded The Slim Shady LP and took the rap music world by storm. On a roll with Dre and an enviable list of hot new acts, Jimmy was nevertheless worried that the music bubble would burst due to the emergence of Napster, and looked to forge corporate-marketing partnerships to boost the visibility and incomes of his artists. An opportune sit-down between Jimmy and Dre led to the idea of Beats Electronics, the speaker-headphone phenomenon that vaulted the partners to new heights, and paved the way for an historic 2014 deal with Apple. The world's most valuable company wasn't just interested in headphones: it was investing in the genius of Jimmy and Dre, who continue to innovate at Apple Music while picking up accolades--Dre was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame with N.W.A. last year--and giving back to the communities that fostered their unique talents.","production_code":"","runtime":59,"season_number":1,"show_id":72141,"still_path":"/5DNpnPVtrvhMvlwFRVVnMKYSbGK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5ec2b936d2147c0023b7f8a3","order":505,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3186,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Trent
