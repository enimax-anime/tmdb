By the time Steve arrives, the fire has been put out and Callum has pulled the tractor unit onto a low loader. But there's still the mammoth task of lifting what's left of the trailer onto another low loader. Steve and his team move a crane into position, but Dave notices that ash on the trailer is still burning — which could be extremely dangerous if the wind picks up, causing it to re-ignite. They decide to tip the trailer's remaining contents onto the road, making it much safer. Once this is done, they can concentrate on the lift, but the trailer is so badly damaged by fire that it could break up while in the air. So the team must be ultracautious as they attempt this recovery. Lantern boys Daniel and Steve have been called to rescue a trailer that's suffered a serious blow from the branch of an overhanging tree.",
