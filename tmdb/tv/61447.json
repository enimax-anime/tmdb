At the hospital she runs into Jasmin and Dev, who have had to interrupt baby Amber's naming ceremony when Vicky fears for the twins. However Vicky delivers them safely as well as giving her answer to a proposition by Chris, father of her child. As a result there is a new venue for the naming ceremony, the hospital, attended by the other mothers and their partners, who have plans for a collective future. Returning home Roanna gets a shock, as do Andrew and Nathan.",

At the hospital she runs into Jasmin and Dev, who have had to interrupt baby Amber's naming ceremony when Vicky fears for the twins. However Vicky delivers them safely as well as giving her answer to a proposition by Chris, father of her child. As a result there is a new venue for the naming ceremony, the hospital, attended by the other mothers and their partners, who have plans for a collective future. Returning home Roanna gets a shock, as do Andrew and Nathan.",
