Highlights from the season include a historic home in Cartersville, Georgia, where the duo investigates a terrified mother's claims of strange paranormal activity and soon discover aggressive entities and evidence of a shocking murder. In Santaquin, Utah, the team explores disturbing paranormal reports at a family-owned restaurant, along with a residence in Elizabeth City, North Carolina housing a tragic past. Additional sites include the Slocum House Theater in Vancouver, Washington, where increasingly odd unexplained activity and ghostly apparitions have left its staff fearful for their safety, and a family home in Wichita, Kansas that is the center of a bone-chilling paranormal mystery dating back to the cowboy days of the 1800s.",
