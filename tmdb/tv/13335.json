It's a pity the butcher is dead, because he has a few questions to answer about why the body of a doctor was found hanging from a meat hook all those years ago at the back of his market stall. It's an episode peppered with revelations. We discover Gerry Standing's very interesting family history - he's descended from French Huguenots and is thus tormented by his colleagues for being a fake cockney, much to his annoyance: \"Je suis ang-bleedingglais!\" he protests. But it's Sandra who has to face up to a startling personal disclosure that has a direct bearing on the case and also throws a whole new light on her father.
