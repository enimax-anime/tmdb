It aired on KBS2 from January 6 to March 25, 2010 on Wednesdays and Thursdays at 21:55 for 24 episodes.\n\nAn adequate display of muscular brawn, intricate yet gritty fight scenes, bawdy humor and eloquent moments of pathos and humanity made the series both visually and intellectually appealing to audiences. Critics gave special mention to director Kwak Jung-hwan's lush cinematography, the use of a Red One camera giving each shot its theater-worthy luster. The hit series topped the ratings chart for 7 consecutive weeks, averaging 31.7% and reaching a peak of 35.9%.\n\nThe series was honored at the Seoul International Drama Awards, and the KBS Drama Awards. Jang also received a best actor nomination from the 2011 International Emmy Awards for his performance.","popularity":13.467,"poster_path":"/j4TL2CKDxUxUKSLwBL89cbUxqoU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":70599,"logo_path":"/6BPMZOHO2nkp7i3NYpy4287Kl4Y.png","name":"Chorokbaem Media","origin_country":"KR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"KR","name":"South Korea"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2010-01-06","episode_count":24,"id":42974,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Korean","iso_639_1":"ko","name":"한국어/조선말"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.762,"vote_count":21,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52589e28760ee34661625404","air_date":"2010-01-06","episodes":[{"air_date":"2010-01-06","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":755458,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"Slaves who ran away were rounded up by bounty hunters called chuno-kkun. “Chuno” itself is a portmanteau word combining “chase” with “slave”; hence, slave hunter.","production_code":"","runtime":70,"season_number":1,"show_id":31424,"still_path":"/zFhjKeKunRBLcuTjL01MQZM9ftd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-01-07","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":755459,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"In the Manchu war, amidst the chaos and fighting, invaders had raided homes and dragged off their inhabitants.","production_code":"","runtime":70,"season_number":1,"show_id":31424,"still_path":"/bwv6S5obbVDaalKQqfMaB81q8BR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-01-13","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":755460,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"Chun Ji-Ho is nothing if not an opportunist.
