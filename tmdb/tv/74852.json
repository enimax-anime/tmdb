Megan does the school run and makes tea for when Hayley gets in from work. It should be the perfect solution, but with the children all liking different things, meal times can be a bit chaotic and Megan is struggling to keep up with everyone’s demands. At the weekends when Megan’s not around, Hayley relies on takeaways to keep everyone happy, but this is costing her a small fortune.\n\nGregg and Chris are determined to get Hayley and Megan working together and cooking one meal in the evening that everyone will enjoy. Chris also visits a local butcher to find out why we should be eating British meat and takes to the streets to see what the public think of some lesser known, cheaper cuts.",

This call for help is a bit different, as it is Karen and John’s grown-up children, Kim and Alex, who got in touch. After a tough year caring for Karen’s elderly mother and dealing with the loss of John’s brother, the couple’s diets have taken a back seat. Surviving on sweet treats, snacks, takeaways and eating out means healthy eating has gone out the window. Cooking from scratch has fallen by the wayside and convenient readymade sauces are their go-to when they do venture into the kitchen. Alex and Kim may have flown the nest, but they remain concerned for their parents’ health, and in a last bid attempt to get them to change their ways, they have called for backup.  Will Gregg and Chris convince the Killeens that cooking from scratch is easier and tastier than their usual takeaways?",

With the girls growing up and Rachel soon off to university, Clare realises her girls need some kitchen skills.

With a two-year-old and a four-month-old, life is hectic for parents Aliyah and Ajaz, and a lack of time isn’t the only challenge the family face. Aliyah and Ajaz have very different tastes when it comes to food. Ajaz loves meat and uses chilli to spice up everything he eats, but Aliyah prefers milder flavours and isn’t keen on red meat, so they never eat the same meal and often end up resorting to takeaways. This is costing them more money and wasting food they already have. Aliyah and Ajaz want to reduce their red meat consumption, increase their veg and stop their reliance on takeaways.  Chris visits a chilli farm in Devon to try the world’s hottest chilli, and a team of tennis players test five lemonades to see which they prefer. Gregg shows Chris some easy tricks to increase your fruit and veg consumption, and the pair make a simple but tasty vegetarian pie.",
