Carl Betz co-stars as her pediatrician husband Dr. Alex Stone, and Shelley Fabares and Paul Petersen as their teenage children, Mary and Jeff. The show originally aired on ABC from September 24, 1958 to March 19, 1966. When Fabares left the show in 1963, Petersen's little sister, Patty Petersen, joined the cast as adopted daughter Trisha. Patty Petersen had first appeared in the episode, \"A Way of Her Own\", on January 31, 1963.\n\nBob Crane and Ann McCrea appeared in the last seasons as the Kelseys, friends of the Stones, and Darryl Richard became a near regular as Smitty, Jeff's best buddy. The show featured a variety of celebrity guests including Esther Williams as a famous dress designer, baseball superstars Don Drysdale and Willie Mays as themselves, teen heartthrob James Darren as a pop singer with the measles, canine superstar Lassie as herself, and young Jay North of CBS's Dennis the Menace.\n\nThe series was created by William S. Roberts and developed by Reed and her then husband, producer Tony Owen. Episodes revolved around typical family problems of the period such as firing a clumsy housekeeper, throwing a retirement bash for a colleague, and finding quality time away from the children. Edgy themes such as women's rights and freedom of the press were occasionally explored.","popularity":26.485,"poster_path":"/vfL1ZzxnvbLH9XaV2C8MMTS32se.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":2,"id":20947,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1958-09-24","episode_count":37,"id":20944,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/tL9zCqUXWGEoH2zX378MuW7z01t.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1959-09-24","episode_count":38,"id":20942,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/t579qPhr1VVQmiYn3kyFj16Lisj.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1960-09-15","episode_count":38,"id":20941,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/CVBPfMOK7IobvwiE2axO6IXUBJ.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1961-09-14","episode_count":39,"id":20943,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/ddECawoOwXxhVn2attFCsoBtxND.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1962-09-20","episode_count":34,"id":20939,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/iJZxPbAxSnV9HepV8cjvs7JSD8K.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1963-09-19","episode_count":32,"id":20940,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":6,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1964-09-17","episode_count":30,"id":20945,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":7,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1965-09-16","episode_count":27,"id":20946,"name":"Season 8","overview":"","poster_path":"/zfLnJb1NuZ1VWYR8sggIpXsR2Sr.jpg","season_number":8,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":12,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525804f819c29531db39bfa3","air_date":"1958-09-24","episodes":[{"air_date":"1958-09-24","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":432718,"name":"Weekend Trip","overview":"This is the very first episode of the long-running series, in which audiences were introduced to the beloved Stone family.
