Chelsea and Chuy bring on her current stable of round table regulars. What Chelsea believes is going to be three of her closest celebrity friends, Mary McCormack - her best friend - Jennifer Aniston, and Sandra Bullock, providing a gracious send-off ends up being what they hope will be more useful for Chelsea's life. Chelsea's ex-lover 50 Cent and G-Unit perform their new single, \"Watch Me\". Chuy, via a prepared video, talks about what this show and Chelsea have meant to him. Miley Cyrus, in tribute to it being the last show, performs the pop classic, \"It's Over\". And many of Chelsea's musical friends, and some non-musical friends, help her serenade E!, to who she is grateful for the past seven years.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"2014-08-26","episode_number":129,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":8,"show_id":13189,"still_path":null},"name":"Chelsea Lately","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":76,"logo_path":"/ptpx2Ag52sYJG6LiX9zBlnKsQOS.png","name":"E!","origin_country":"US"}],"number_of_episodes":1186,"number_of_seasons":8,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Chelsea Lately","overview":"Comedian Chelsea Handler spoofs celebrities, TV, movies, news, while dishing out her personal views on current events with the help of a rotating panel of comedians.","popularity":23.877,"poster_path":"/h7kmKQKGoFv2GgDWpybqB8Zb29.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26040,"logo_path":"/zBCrPWSBUZc7Dm0pFA07phnTjEX.png","name":"Borderline Amazing Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2009-12-22","episode_count":5,"id":24092,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2007-07-16","episode_count":75,"id":24094,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2008-05-07","episode_count":58,"id":24095,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2009-01-06","episode_count":190,"id":24093,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2010-01-04","episode_count":197,"id":24096,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/GL8tp12MyaSwQzKC9zeXxTvEbu.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2011-01-03","episode_count":194,"id":24097,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2012-01-02","episode_count":196,"id":24098,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":6,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2013-01-07","episode_count":153,"id":24099,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":7,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2014-01-01","episode_count":123,"id":61336,"name":"Season 8","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":8,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Talk Show","vote_average":4.2,"vote_count":16,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525825eb760ee36aaa806393","air_date":"2007-07-16","episodes":[{"air_date":"2007-07-16","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":493589,"name":"Episode 101","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":13189,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2007-07-17","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":493590,"name":"Season 1, Episode 2","overview":"Comedian Chelsea Handler talks about celebrity gossip, pop culture and interviews celebrities while giving her audience something to laugh at.
