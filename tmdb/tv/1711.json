On Sunday, for the results show, Daly is joined by It Takes Two presenter Claudia Winkleman.\n\nThe celebrities did not know their professional partners until they were introduced to each other at the launch show.",

The show was broadcast from Wembley Arena on 19 November with all proceeds going to the BBC charity, Children in Need. The final took place at the Blackpool Tower Ballroom and was the first episode in 3D, and was shown on BBC HD and 18 cinemas around the country. As in Series 8 there are 14 couples with one new male professional, Pasha Kovalev, replacing Jared Murillo.\n\nThe Saturday show was presented by Sir Bruce Forsyth and Tess Daly, while the Sunday results show was presented by Daly with Claudia Winkleman. Former contestant Zoë Ball replaced Winkleman as the regular host of the spin-off show It Takes Two due to Winkleman's family commitments. On 5 and 6 November Jennifer Grey, the winner of the eleventh series of Dancing with the Stars, the American version of 'Strictly', was a guest judge, replacing Len Goodman while he had a week off. In Goodman's absence, Craig Revel Horwood was Head Judge.\n\nThe full lineup of celebrities was revealed on 6 September 2011 on The One Show. As in the previous series, the celebrities did not know who would be their professional partner until they were introduced to each other at the Launch Show. McFly drummer Harry Judd and Aliona Vilani won the show on 17 December 2011.",

The competition will be no less intense on coming back to familiar territory, though, as the celebrities and their seasoned dancing partners draw closer to the grand final. Judges Shirley Ballas, Bruno Tonioli, Darcey Bussell and Craig Revel Horwood are on hand to assess each pairing's skills as they perform their individual routines, before they all tackle the Paso Doble at the same time in a `Pasodoblathon'. As ever, though, the impressing the judges is only half of the battle, as the stars must also gain the approval of the viewing public, who are given a chance to have their say over who should stay in the running.",
