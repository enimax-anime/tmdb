The show was created by Avi Arad, and it centers around Mutant X, a team of \"New Mutants\" who possess extraordinary powers as a result of genetic engineering. The members of Mutant X were used as test subjects in a series of covert government experiments. The mission of Mutant X is to seek out and protect their fellow New Mutants. The series was filmed in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.\n\nEven though the series had high ratings and was meant to be renewed for a fourth season, it was abruptly canceled in 2004 after the dismantling of Fireworks Entertainment, one of the show's production companies, ending the show on a cliffhanger.","popularity":28.08,"poster_path":"/yiKg027jdpkSsguVBI9WqliNWez.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2001-10-06","episode_count":22,"id":3883,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/xySR86ad5hy9lW54vEbKqW8HZ96.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2002-10-05","episode_count":22,"id":3884,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/6XpzAQrlJG67fGPfMw9NVNDeeLE.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2003-09-29","episode_count":22,"id":3885,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/2AdaxX1NGPvsN2FcfbU23iVPeeF.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":10}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"Creation can have it's side effects","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.625,"vote_count":88,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525704f7760ee3776a009cd9","air_date":"2001-10-06","episodes":[{"air_date":"2001-10-06","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":66970,"name":"The Shock of the New (1)","overview":"A mutant empath on the run from mysterious government agents is rescued by a team of fellow \"\"New Mutants\"\" - the group known as Mutant X.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":1449,"still_path":"/sJxHrO2kiNckbwP7PgMOkIB0prW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525704f7760ee3776a009d54","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":20976,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"T.J.
