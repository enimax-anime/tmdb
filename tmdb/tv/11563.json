The street shown at the start of each programme is Elswick Street. A family called Boswell had also featured in Lane's earlier sitcom The Liver Birds and Lane admitted in interviews that the two families were probably related.\n\nNellie's feckless and estranged husband, Freddie, left her for another woman known as 'Lilo Lill'. Her children Joey, Jack, Adrian, Aveline and Billy continued to live in the family home in Kelsall Street and contributed money to the central family fund, largely through benefit fraud and the sale of stolen goods.","popularity":14.052,"poster_path":"/jUDoYVLJralNogkkIFlChMhjtJn.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1986-05-01","episode_count":6,"id":22040,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1987-01-08","episode_count":6,"id":22041,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1987-09-06","episode_count":13,"id":22042,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1988-11-20","episode_count":14,"id":22039,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1989-09-10","episode_count":14,"id":22043,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1990-09-09","episode_count":11,"id":22044,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":6,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1991-09-01","episode_count":10,"id":22045,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":7,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":21,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258113319c29531db46151e","air_date":"1986-05-01","episodes":[{"air_date":"1986-05-01","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":454876,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"The family talks about their dreams and what they hope to achieve in the future.
