The film begins with scenes depicting Moana Pozzi (Violent Placido) under the shower, traumatized and dirty with blood, which recalls, in a state of shock, some episodes of his childhood when, for example, together with sister Mima he did Sub diving with his father or a time when he dances inappropriately in front of a man at a party, triggering his mother's wrath. After that, the narrative stabilizes for a while by showing us a young Moana who goes to a screening for a movie bringing a dream extract from William Shakespeare's mid-summer night. The filmmakers are impressed by the beauty of the girl who does not, however, accompany an equally excellent recitative talent.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":43455,"still_path":"/kATH5gtVu6hAsqLM4l2osDNu5k8.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"59528667c3a368151c0217ad","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":227239,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Cristiano Bortone","original_name":"Cristiano Bortone","popularity":1.08,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"595286709251412a9b02586d","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1840128,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leonardo Breccia","original_name":"Leonardo Breccia","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"595286499251411dbd00533e","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":134127,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Alfredo Peyretti","original_name":"Alfredo Peyretti","popularity":2.268,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2009-12-02","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"finale","id":1332248,"name":"Parte seconda","overview":"Moana and Antonio leave for the United States and secretly enter the wedding.
