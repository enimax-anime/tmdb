                    "overview": "Buddy heads to two restaurants that are known as much for their Hollywood connection, as they are for serving delicious food. First, he heads to The Victor Cafe in Philadelphia, which is as famous for appearing in the Rocky Balboa and Creed movies and for their tableside opera performances. After belting out a few tunes, Buddy heads to the kitchen with Chef Rick to learn how to make their pillowy gnocchi and one of Buddy's all-time favorite Italian dishes: veal saltimbocca. Next he's heading to El Coyote--a well-known Hollywood stomping ground and setting for some classic movies, to try their cheesy enchiladas, savory chili rellenos and \"world famous\" margaritas.",
