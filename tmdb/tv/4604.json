Meanwhile Clark prepares for his date with Chloe, reporter Roger Nixon gets wind of Clark's alien origins after setting up an explosion, and Whitney joins the Marine Corps. Lex works with the workers to buy the plant and put it under local management, and his father Lionel threatens to sabotage the efforts by buying up their mortgages.
