A new character was introduced in the first episode of the series. Also for the first five episodes of this series, the \"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\" becomes \"Stars in a Reasonably Priced Car\", featuring two celebrity guests every week, each one setting an individual laptime. In May 2008, after series producer Andy Wilman held a brainstorming session with the presenters and other production staff, various facts about the upcoming series were released. Wilman confirmed that series 11 would see the presenters, Clarkson, Hammond and May, gain more control over the flow of the show's popular news segment. The series included running jokes appearing in each episode: Clarkson showing an image he claims to have found on \"the Internet\" which is censored for the television broadcast; and, in the news section, May appearing to feign enthusiasm whilst presenting a brief news item about the Dacia Sandero with no further discussion before they move on to the next item.",

The running joke regarding the Dacia Sandero continues from series 11, with the alteration that Clarkson is now the one making the announcement with feigned enthusiasm, to utter indifference from May. Each news segment also features one of the hosts wearing something unusual, like slippers or a garishly patterned shirt. The only reference to this is that one of the other hosts will, at some point in the segment, ask if they're wearing it for a bet. The Stig, instead of listening to music during power laps, now listens to morse code. The final episode, the \"Top Gear: Vietnam Special\", aired two weeks after the rest of the series as part of the BBC's Christmas line-up. The series was followed by four \"Best Of Top Gear\" specials, charting the best moments from Series 11 and 12.",

There’s a race between a grumpy teen on an all terrain board and a Mitsubishi Evo7 Group N rally car - and a Bowler Wildcat just for good measure. Ben Collins drives the cars - (Stig without his helmet?)  Jeremy compares super cars from the 1980s with their modern counterparts to see if the more modern up-to-date cars are really better. Pagani Zonda, Porsche Carrera GT, Ferrari Enzo are the modern super cars and the throw-backs are the, Jaguar XJ220, McLaren F1 and the Ferrari F40.\n\nGeri Halliwell is the Star in a Reasonably Priced Car.",

Unable to leave the car, they relied on passers-by to get them things such as: tea, pasties and newspapers. They spent the night parked in the Screaming Woods in Pluckley, the 'most haunted village in England'.The village 'boasts' 12 ghosts including: the Highwayman, the Screaming Man and a monk.

This series included a revised title sequence, following the same visual style as with the sequence used for Series 8 through 10, but incorporating footage from the two prior series. A new character was introduced in the first episode of the series. Also for the first five episodes of this series, the \"Star in a Reasonably Priced Car\" becomes \"Stars in a Reasonably Priced Car\", featuring two celebrity guests every week, each one setting an individual laptime. In May 2008, after series producer Andy Wilman held a brainstorming session with the presenters and other production staff, various facts about the upcoming series were released. Wilman confirmed that series 11 would see the presenters, Clarkson, Hammond and May, gain more control over the flow of the show's popular news segment. The series included running jokes appearing in each episode: Clarkson showing an image he claims to have found on \"the Internet\" which is censored for the television broadcast; and, in the news section, May appearing to feign enthusiasm whilst presenting a brief news item about the Dacia Sandero with no further discussion before they move on to the next item.",

Clarkson was injured while filming the series, after crashing a lorry through a brick wall at 56 mph in the first episode's HGV challenge. The running joke regarding the Dacia Sandero continues from series 11, with the alteration that Clarkson is now the one making the announcement with feigned enthusiasm, to utter indifference from May. Each news segment also features one of the hosts wearing something unusual, like slippers or a garishly patterned shirt. The only reference to this is that one of the other hosts will, at some point in the segment, ask if they're wearing it for a bet. The Stig, instead of listening to music during power laps, now listens to morse code. The final episode, the \"Top Gear: Vietnam Special\", aired two weeks after the rest of the series as part of the BBC's Christmas line-up. The series was followed by four \"Best Of Top Gear\" specials, charting the best moments from Series 11 and 12.",

In the clip, the parents of a young boy see the Top Gear crew filming the motorhome challenge. The over-excited responses of the parents were adapted to produce the trailer. Several segments which were recorded for the series were missed out, including Jeremy travelling from the most westerly point at sunset to the most easterly point at sunrise in the new Jaguar XJ, and the return of Jonathan Ross to the reasonably priced car. The series was followed by two \"Best Of Top Gear\" specials, charting the best moments from the series.",
