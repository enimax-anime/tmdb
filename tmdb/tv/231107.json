Finally, he looks at historic models of the know universe by Ptolemy and Copernicus and discusses some of the theological ramifications of science.",

He then looks at the early planet Earth and discusses why there is only one tree of life. He considers extremophiles that have the ability to live in environments that appear hostile to life and examines the theory that microscopic life may have originally come to Earth from outer space. He talks about chirality in organic molecules before discussing the question of intelligence",

He then examines dark energy which is the unknown force causing the expansion of the universe to accelerate. He also considers some anomalies facing quantum mechanics and the theory of the Zero-energy universe. Finally, he examines the likely collision between the Milky Way and the Andromeda galaxy.",
