Things go askew, however, when the device proves Erika’s honesty: she was outside the administration building at the time of the fire, and she saw someone who looked like Wilson running away. Adding to the upheaval is Margot Miller’s recovery from her coma. Suddenly, there’s someone else who might have information about everything leading up to the fire. The Liars' Club may have narrowed down their suspect list, but the mystery is far from being resolved.",
