On March 19, 2012, MTV confirmed that the series would return for their sixth season. On August 30, 2012, MTV announced that the Jersey Shore would end after the sixth season, which premiered on October 4. The series finale aired on December 20, 2012.\n\nThe show debuted amid large amounts of controversy regarding the use of the words \"Guido/Guidette,\" portrayals of Italian-American stereotypes, and scrutiny from locals because the cast members were not residents of the area.\n\nThe series garnered record ratings for MTV, making it the network's most viewed series telecast ever.
