As blood is spilled, and tensions mount, Charles Vane must decide which he values more: Eleanor’s life, or the respect of his men. \n\nAnd unbeknownst to all of them, a prize of immeasurable value has already been smuggled onto the island … one whose discovery will alter the very landscape of their world, and force everyone in Nassau toward the ultimate judgment: are they men, or are they monsters?","poster_path":"/fKSiM39cm7UFDjsl3zZpcggDTJt.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":8.4},{"air_date":"2016-01-23","episode_count":10,"id":68865,"name":"Season 3","overview":"In the wake of Charles Town, the world lives in fear of Captain Flint.

With the help of Eleanor Guthrie, Woodes Rogers transforms Nassau into a fortress without walls, as Captain Flint amasses a fleet of unprecedented strength, hoping to strike the final blow against civilization and reshape the world forever. Meanwhile, from within the island… an insurgency builds, fueled by the legend of its exiled leader, whose name keeps grown men awake at night… the one they call “Long John Silver.” \n\nBut as Flint, Silver and their allies are about to learn, the closer civilization comes to defeat, the more desperately and destructively it will fight back. Oaths will be shattered, fortunes will change hands, and amidst the chaos, only one thing remains certain: it has never been more dangerous to call oneself a pirate.","id":76885,"poster_path":"/subOEoL9l6q03Qc4KktIvHpW632.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":7.9}}}
