The stereotypical view of people from Essex as primped, yakking bozos was exposed by TOWIE as not having gone far enough: each week we scaled new lows of inanity as a gang of young people, steered by the show's producers and embellished by cruel editing, discussed their lives and loves. Sex, petty arguments and unpleasantly intimate beauty treatments were the dominant themes. It's filmed close to transmission to bring you the latest news from the county's night clubs and nail bars, but you can expect fallout from Mark's recent split from his glamour-model girlfriend, Amy's efforts to deal with fame and, most likely, some explicit vajazzling scenes.",

Later on in the night, Gemma holds an award ceremony, aptly named the Gemmas, and awards Lydia \"Best Dressed Female\", and Joey \"Best Dressed Male\".\n\nExcusing themselves from the party, Georgina and Lauren P have a chat in the bathroom, with Georgina telling Lauren about how Mario has been calling her and asking her to go to dinner with him, despite him having a girlfriend, but turning him down. Then, Lucy came out of a toilet stall, said, \"But still you're texting a guy who you know has a girlfriend,\" before leaving the bathroom, leaving Georgina and Lauren stunned. Lucy approaches Mario to talk to him about everything she's heard, but Mario defends himself. At the end, he gives her his new number, and she takes it, before walking away.",
