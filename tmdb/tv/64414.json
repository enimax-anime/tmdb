They learn that the only cure to a Red Rose bite is sap from the rare Severum tree, which is located deep in the nearby Maleficent forest. Ruel and Yugo leave to gather the sap while Percedal and Eva stay behind to help care for Amalia. Not long after Ruel and Yugo leave, Amalia's doll goes berserk, attacking Nausea, Percedal, and Eva. It merges with Rubilax, turning into a monstrous demon. The trio overpower it, forcing Rubilax out and cutting the doll up into pieces, but the pieces turn into other dolls and attack in masses. In the forest, Ruel and Yugo are attacked by giant Venus flytraps, but are saved by a forest dweller named Sybannak. They are forced to help her in exchange for the sap, but when the tasks become tedious and monotonous, Ruel instead decides to steal some sap. Enraged, Sybannak attacks with the Venus flytrap monsters. Rue and Yugo escape with the sap and return to Nausea's where they save Amalia and return the dolls back to normal.",

They discover his home is built into a clay mesa and has a special code to keep intruders out and keep his stash of Kamas hidden. Gonnard reveals himself to be a shapeshifting genie that turns into whatever he eats, and as he eats kamas, he's as hard as gold. He overpowers the group and eats more kamas. Ruel, not one to give up his kamas, tricks him into eating chocolate coins instead. Gonnard eats them and turns into chocolate. Ruel traps him inside a glass vase and leaves Gonnard in his vault.",

The baby, having a demigod's strength, causes the tower to crumble from the shockwaves it emanated during labor. Only Oropo's power is preventing the tower itself from collapsing, but only barely. He sends Adamai to find the cause, finding it to be the son that is coming. He decides to keep them safe from the crumbling debris around them so that he and Echo can have a conversation later. Eva gives birth to a boy, ending the shockwaves and the pain, but the tower is in shambles. Oropo and Adamai set the pieces with those alive gently on the ground, allowing everyone to reunite and for Percedal to meet his new son. Before she could head over, however, Fake Ruel knocks out Amalia and transforms into a fake Amalia, sending the real one to Oropo.",

As he reveals his true intentions and the fact that he lied to everyone, with the Sadida Demi-Goddess revealing that it was he who set the world's tragedies into motion, such as Nox finding the Eliacube and Ogrest turning into the demon he was, his brotherhood of demigods start to turn against him. He uses his powers to send Yugo into a coma, where he confronts his demons in the forms of Qilby and Nox, who he had been suffering waking nightmares from since he arrived at the tower.",
