Adrianne's concept, which she called Beauty and the Brady, was a show about her and Knight's then-fledgling romance, in which she would attempt to convince Knight to marry her. Within that episode, Adrianne's idea was passed over in favor of that of castmate Da Brat, but the latter's show never came to fruition.","popularity":2.759,"poster_path":"/z5MekQ1fvnCgCkRVPB1c7piYCci.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2005-09-11","episode_count":9,"id":16890,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2006-05-28","episode_count":10,"id":16891,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2008-01-20","episode_count":7,"id":16892,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5257879e19c29531db2ac7c2","air_date":"2005-09-11","episodes":[{"air_date":"2005-09-11","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":378724,"name":"A Brady, a Lady, a Kiss and a Flo","overview":"Adrianne moving in with Chris was supposed to be a temporary arrangement.
