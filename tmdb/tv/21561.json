As he presents his evidence -- all gleaned from earlier episodes of The Outer Limits -- the powerful begin to interfere. First, they try to shut down his transmitter. Then, the network's parent company disavows the show. When thugs with guns knock down the studio door, Rivers continues the show on the fly, transmitting live from the back of a broadcast news van. But a van can only drive for so long. When it stops, will the truth, even The Whole Truth, be enough to protect Rivers, Strong and the crew?","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":3,"show_id":21561,"still_path":null,"vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":2,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525869ad760ee3466119c9a6","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Philip Azzopardi","original_name":"Mario Philip Azzopardi","popularity":2.412,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525869b7760ee3466119df44","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Naren Shankar","original_name":"Naren Shankar","popularity":1.862,"profile_path":"/z0wldNQR4EooAtpg5UrWUpwHruA.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Donald Rivers","credit_id":"525869b7760ee3466119deee","order":641,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":85199,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alan Thicke","original_name":"Alan Thicke","popularity":4.123,"profile_path":"/2zHmOX2KYnotwD69ceodaWDfPf8.jpg"},{"character":"Sandra","credit_id":"615d59cd36390900638e331c","order":997,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":150967,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stevie Vallance","original_name":"Stevie Vallance","popularity":1.978,"profile_path":"/ziwVbzagnPAJStypYZZqYyQdqGH.jpg"},{"character":"Dr. Avery Strong","credit_id":"64db585cf495ee029431a7a6","order":1326,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":118004,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bruce Harwood","original_name":"Bruce Harwood","popularity":5.498,"profile_path":"/hQK0UV0AAzEOP1m0oIQIhtNmXS.jpg"},{"character":"Dr. Richard Morgan","credit_id":"64db5869f495ee0290e5a385","order":1327,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":77039,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michael St. John Smith","original_name":"Michael St. John Smith","popularity":3.867,"profile_path":"/jzTyMkE0JvBzfTjhmR5xRGUVhOC.jpg"},{"character":"Technician","credit_id":"64db5874f495ee0293569a29","order":1328,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":37696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Lawrence","original_name":"Colin Lawrence","popularity":16.241,"profile_path":"/aFAfFIKB10Kem86i5KbAfdUByLK.jpg"},{"character":"Man","credit_id":"64db587c59e8a900c59f7408","order":1329,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1235619,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Harrison Coe","original_name":"Harrison Coe","popularity":2.262,"profile_path":"/1qY1rGNV7V1H87WA1DQJYy1x6VR.jpg"},{"character":"Spokeswoman Adrian Wheeler","credit_id":"64db588459e8a900e2279abf","order":1330,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":158400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colleen Winton","original_name":"Colleen Winton","popularity":3.271,"profile_path":"/rMZ24VYE6fgRUc1HcHyYPRQqzNp.jpg"},{"character":"Bum","credit_id":"64db5892f495ee0290e5a398","order":1331,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":185277,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gerry Rousseau","original_name":"Gerry Rousseau","popularity":2.206,"profile_path":"/nI9K7NNRf8SOGXET43xN9BbYoIn.jpg"}]}],"name":"Season 3","overview":"","id":31315,"poster_path":"/lmU4U3nWm9gxUQyq0RejV0rK326.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":5.8},"4":{"_id":"525869a6760ee3466119b2ac","air_date":"1998-01-23","episodes":[{"air_date":"1998-01-23","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":597379,"name":"Criminal Nature","overview":"Genetic Engineering has produced a generation of super-babies, but the technology is not perfect.

He has diagnosed Bernard's condition and believes that if he can isolate the part of the brain responsible for fear, the amyglada, he can cure him. The series of injections and radiation designed to build a layer of calcium around the amyglada produces stunning results; Bernard's fear recedes. He even starts a relationship with his neighbor Lisa (Tanya Allen). But there are side effects. Now, Bernard can use his brain to make others feel the kind of crippling fear he used to feel. He is still a prisoner of the past, haunted by images of Mr. Wilkes (Alex Diakun), the owner of the foster home where Bernard's sister died.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":4,"show_id":21561,"still_path":null,"vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525869b7760ee3466119df44","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1219378,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Naren

As the clock ticks, Martin tries to reason with Todtman while the military tries to find a way to disarm the device.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":4,"show_id":21561,"still_path":null,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525869ad760ee3466119c9a6","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44132,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Mario Philip Azzopardi","original_name":"Mario Philip Azzopardi","popularity":2.412,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525869bc760ee3466119e8d9","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1216937,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carleton Eastlake","original_name":"Carleton Eastlake","popularity":1.556,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1998-07-03","episode_number":17,"episode_type":"standard","id":597397,"name":"Lithia","overview":"It is 2055 and the post-apocalyptic world is populated exclusively by women; all the men were killed in the Great War and the Scourge that followed. Into this matriarchy comes Major Jason Mercer (David Keith), who was cryogenically frozen forty years earlier and now awakened in Lithia. Lithia is a small agricultural enclave overseen by a group of women that include the regal elder Hera (Julie Harris), Ariel (Claire Rankin), Miranda (Nadia Capone) and Pele (Kirsten Williamson). Mercer's arrival sparks a debate about the nature of men among some women and   revives long-dormant sexual feelings in others. The debate intensifies as Mercer, seeing the enclave's poverty and primitive tools, begins to repair the community's broken machines and pushes Miranda, the group's trade representative to barter with Hyacinth, a neighboring community, for electricity to run the machines. Over the objections of the elders, Mercer gets the machines running.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":4,"show_id":21561,"still_path":null,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":3,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525869b1760ee3466119d068","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":4160,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Shaver","original_name":"Helen Shaver","popularity":14.402,"profile_path":"/4RcaswFfLR8D3bQBHVlxyBR0R0H.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525869b0760ee3466119ced5","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44808,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sam Egan","original_name":"Sam Egan","popularity":2.832,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1998-07-10","episode_number":18,"episode_type":"standard","id":597391,"name":"Monster","overview":"The four people gathered in the top-secret research facility seem at first to have nothing in common: Ford Maddox (Harry Hamlin) is a former spy, Rachel Sanders (Nicole Deboer) is a nurse, Roger Beckersly (Aaron Pearl) is an Army Ranger and Louise McDonnaugh (Bridget O'Sullivan) is a computer programmer.

Declan gets a 20 minute head start, but he's got a microchip in his brain that's tuned to the taser that Allison carries.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":6,"show_id":21561,"still_path":null,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525869aa760ee3466119bf48","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25882,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Brad Turner","original_name":"Brad Turner","popularity":5.106,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525869df760ee346611a25e7","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1215611,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Scott Nimerfro","original_name":"Scott Nimerfro","popularity":1.154,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Jill Cooper","credit_id":"525869c7760ee346611a021b","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":74370,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nicole Oliver","original_name":"Nicole Oliver","popularity":9.778,"profile_path":"/plAsVfhTrYaU78JrZbJSQ4uXpX1.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525869db760ee346611a1baf","order":572,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1534,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Elliott","original_name":"Chris Elliott","popularity":24.431,"profile_path":"/t8sdwz8iV7dQWQlYb2rPMKepT8h.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525869db760ee346611a1be5","order":828,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kevin McNulty","original_name":"Kevin McNulty","popularity":10.869,"profile_path":"/jaXuLA5zYPVzfG8wLtnD2O4aveA.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525869db760ee346611a1c0f","order":892,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":21625,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Molly Ringwald","original_name":"Molly Ringwald","popularity":24.723,"profile_path":"/AijekZAJbKNBdIOCvP9EilMVREO.jpg"},{"character":"Mr. Tarkman","credit_id":"525869cc760ee346611a0a59","order":917,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":25386,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ian Tracey","original_name":"Ian Tracey","popularity":16.808,"profile_path":"/dUzzLVVUF0pvGzS3xrIZ5tiC2TT.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525869db760ee346611a1c39","order":922,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":158521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colin Foo","original_name":"Colin Foo","popularity":2.611,"profile_path":"/6k8GidgaTlsC8gWAVmXbhWf4U00.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525869db760ee346611a1c63","order":955,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":89548,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Louis Chirillo","original_name":"Louis Chirillo","popularity":3.74,"profile_path":"/baww87hN2rWzQLbRu9uM6aXlfbD.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525869db760ee346611a1c8d","order":969,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":64680,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tony Alcantar","original_name":"Tony Alcantar","popularity":3.183,"profile_path":"/2pxOVnaesNC1PBhtAt4lzaD1PAI.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2000-01-28","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":597483,"name":"The Gun","overview":"When Matthew Logan gets out of prison after serving time for spousal abuse,   his first stop is a gun show.
