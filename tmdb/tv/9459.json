At the end of most predicaments, Alvin, in variable degrees of frustration, would say, \"I shall leave you now, Elizabeth\" and would walk out of sight. The announcer would say, \"Elizabeth, aren't you ashamed?\" She would slowly nod, but then, with a slightly devilish grin, would vigorously shake her head to indicate she wasn't.\n\nLife with Elizabeth was an American sitcom airing in syndication from October 7, 1953 to September 1, 1955. It starred Betty White as Elizabeth and Del Moore as her husband Alvin; Jack Narz wa the on-camera announcer and narrator.\n\nThe low-budget comedy was produced by and filmed at a local Los Angeles TV station where White and Moore were on the staff. Betty White received her first Primetime Emmy Award for her work on this series.","popularity":2.368,"poster_path":"/gX9S53W9t3x7piVYkhWPrpBEjMo.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":61963,"logo_path":null,"name":"Guild Films","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1953-01-01","episode_count":36,"id":19310,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":3.5,"vote_count":2,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525796e1760ee36aaa72d8f3","air_date":"1953-01-01","episodes":[{"air_date":"1953-01-01","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":4174444,"name":"Not for the Birds/Sleep Problem/Bowling","overview":"1) Elizabeth brings home a parrot. 2) Elizabeth gets angry with Alvin for falling asleep while she's chatting. 3) One of Alvin's bowling buddies comes by early and interrupts their dinner with talk of germs.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":9459,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Dave","credit_id":"63c8b96cabdec000ae24b7c2","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83991,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jess Kirkpatrick","original_name":"Jess Kirkpatrick","popularity":1.92,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":"1953-11-20","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":407334,"name":"Bad Mood; First Kiss; Ex-Flame","overview":"Three separate stories in the life of our two protagonists.
