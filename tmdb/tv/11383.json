The title character is Arizona rancher and aircraft pilot Schuyler \"Sky\" King. The series was likely based on a true-life personality of the 1930s, Jack Cones, the \"Flying Constable\" of Twentynine Palms in San Bernardino County, California, although this claim is unverified.\n\nAlthough the series had strong western elements, King mostly captured criminals and spies, and found lost hikers with the use of his plane, the Songbird. Though the planes used changed during the course of the series, the later model was not given a number, but was still known as the Songbird.\n\nKing and his niece, Penny, lived on the Flying Crown Ranch, near the town of Grover, Arizona. Penny and Clipper were also pilots, though still relatively inexperienced and looking to their uncle for guidance and mentoring. Penny was an accomplished air racer and rated multi-engine pilot, whom Sky trusted to fly the Songbird. In the third TV episode, Penny refers to Clipper as \"my brother\", so they are siblings.\n\nThe musical score was largely the work of Herschel Burke Gilbert.","popularity":7.84,"poster_path":"/chgNF3Hk7JpuYsZHjPQakyv4to0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":60327,"logo_path":null,"name":"McGowan Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":56298,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jack Chertok Television Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1952-04-05","episode_count":19,"id":69402,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1956-01-02","episode_count":20,"id":69403,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1957-12-29","episode_count":20,"id":69404,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1958-12-28","episode_count":13,"id":69405,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":4.8,"vote_count":5,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"55c5c3b2c3a3682f2b0015e5","air_date":"1952-04-05","episodes":[{"air_date":"1952-04-05","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1095883,"name":"Operation Urgent","overview":"During a fierce thunderstorm, Sky picks up a mayday call from a Air Force courier plane which is about to run out of gas.
