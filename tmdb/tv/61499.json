Now, after returning from a romantic two-week island vacation, Jake’s all set to pop the question. Before he can ask, though, Annie lets loose on Jake for his inability to commit. She was expecting him to “put a ring on it” in paradise and now Jake’s perfect proposal is ruined. Not wanting to spend the next 60 years talking about that mess of a proposal, Jake and Annie decide to hold off on the engagement until they can do it right. Yet if history tells us anything, it’s when we really want things to go right that they all tend to go wrong. The only thing we know for sure is these two are destined to be together whether they can get it together or not.","popularity":4.887,"poster_path":"/iUT8oHqb8N7jqaZCU8NpRlylZFd.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2015-04-23","episode_count":4,"id":151032,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2014-10-14","episode_count":14,"id":63012,"name":"Season 1","overview":"As Annie and Jake return to their apartment in Chicago from a romantic two-week island holiday, they're about to reach a tricky-to-negotiate relationship crossroads.","poster_path":"/3en9b1La0WioVqrNLlTxbnDieUH.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":6.1}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"Together every crazy step of the way","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":13,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"543e1e80c3a36825040018d8","air_date":"2014-10-14","episodes":[{"air_date":"2014-10-14","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1011777,"name":"Pilot","overview":"Annie is furious about Jake's inability to commit just as he's about to ask her to marry him.","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":61499,"still_path":"/dE6qALO7Hnr2UGTS4XleceYU9mw.jpg","vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"crew":[{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"543e249e0e0a266f81001980","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":524128,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"David Caspe","original_name":"David Caspe","popularity":0.791,"profile_path":"/9EZkU4XwohUhihvwAYfMBAMJyJp.jpg"},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"543e248ac3a368251f00191a","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71600,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Seth Gordon","original_name":"Seth Gordon","popularity":4.226,"profile_path":"/3V2gHFkbez8iGTdlYyS9NxMujfw.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Waitress","credit_id":"543e24ca0e0a266f7d0019dd","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1141053,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Deanna Cheng","original_name":"Deanna Cheng","popularity":1.821,"profile_path":"/wDjj6zA8z2ExASCGn6uadwdWbBd.jpg"},{"character":"Myrna","credit_id":"543e24e50e0a266f8b001938","order":501,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10080,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"JoBeth Williams","original_name":"JoBeth Williams","popularity":9.601,"profile_path":"/As6PDqSwJjLEtYnUBcigGBrcxUZ.jpg"},{"character":"Jake’s Boss","credit_id":"5f184b6151e6ab0036caf419","order":512,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1230842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Leslie David Baker","original_name":"Leslie David Baker","popularity":12.476,"profile_path":"/9h3xlV5IYqKinlQCW1ouU7sjwWF.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2014-10-21","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1011778,"name":"Move Me","overview":"Annie is stressed over sharing her apartment with Jake.
