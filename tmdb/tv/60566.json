Attempting to secure an order for British helicopters from the president Keith starts badly by shooting an ibex, the national animal of the country, though he manages to blame the French ambassador. Keith's capable deputy Neil Tilly and his assistant Caitlin are more concerned with securing the release of activist Simon Broughton from prison. Neil is approached by a national who blackmails him with incriminating photos into \"helping us\", though Simon is released. Keith organizes a British evening to impress the president, including arrogant actor Stephen Pembridge performing a one man show of Frankenstein, Morris dancers and a chutney-making demonstration. In the event the contract goes to the French, who have brought in a cabinet minister to stress the importance of the transaction.\n\n- Written by don @ minifie-1","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":60566,"still_path":"/3lickDUaaPYNFNw7QgCVf5ZFVFr.jpg","vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-10-30","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":971893,"name":"The Prince's Trousers","overview":"The embassy welcomes the annoying minor royal and trade envoy Prince Mark of Bath, who has come to the country to help secure the licence for Anglo-Brit oil. He is extremely vain, taking an ironing board everywhere to keep his trousers crease-free and a difficult guest, demanding sexual threesomes. Meanwhile Neil is sheltering Amil Zarifi, an anti-government dissident who has escaped from jail and is hiding in the embassy with Jennifer's approval. Learning that the information Neil was blackmailed into giving them was false and aware of Zafifi's presence in the embassy, the secret police want him handed over to them and Keith wants to comply to save the oil contract. But Zarifi finds an unexpected ally when he bumps into Mark and they get drunk together, Zarifi horrifying Mark with stories of the Tazbekistan regime. This in turn leads to Mark delivering an amazing speech to the president which secures the oil deal as well as Zarifi's freedom.\n\n- Written by don @ minifie-1","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":60566,"still_path":"/wd5ypUqSsLI7r25PODmGO1ofUZY.jpg","vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-11-06","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"finale","id":971894,"name":"The Tazbek Spring","overview":"Hard-as-nails government vetting officer Robert Jackson arrives in Tazbekistan and walks the fifteen miles from the airport for the embassy staff appraisal.
