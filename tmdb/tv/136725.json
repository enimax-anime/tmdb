From hunting killers who hid in the shadows for decades, to taking on a political machine with more than blood on its hands, to reliving the same murder through three different victims in a row, every crime turns the story back on each detective, triggering memories of painstaking investigations, forcing them to come to terms with old wounds, and revealing what drives them to stand strong in the fight for justice.",
