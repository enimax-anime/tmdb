The first series of 5 episodes ran from 14 August to 11 September 2012.\n\nThe show was originally due to be broadcast on Sky One but was delayed in order to launch on Sky Living as part of the channel's push into more female skewed comedy. The Show was filmed in Enfield, North London in August 2011 therefore making the show heavily delayed from its initial broadcast.","popularity":3.159,"poster_path":"/BmiP1RXUuK2F0Ppyl17g6lndog.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21414,"logo_path":null,"name":"Feelgood Fiction","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2012-08-14","episode_count":5,"id":86057,"name":"Series 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7,"vote_count":3,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"58c2c51a92514104e4012079","air_date":"2012-08-14","episodes":[{"air_date":"2012-08-14","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1285507,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":59355,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-08-21","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1285508,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":59355,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-08-28","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1285509,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":59355,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-09-04","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":1285510,"name":"Episode 4","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":59355,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-09-11","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"finale","id":1285511,"name":"Episode 5","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":59355,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Series 1","overview":"","id":86057,"poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
