Similar to another truTV show, Southern Fried Stings, the series is filmed in a cinema verité style but consists of scripted and dramatized performances by actors. The show is filmed by recreating scenes in which the cast conducts repossessions of automobiles for finance companies. In the show they also perform repossessions of other exotic and strange items such as luxury boats, planes, limousines, motorcycles, ATVs, Zambonis, ice cream trucks, tow trucks, buses, trucks, expensive bicycles, hot air balloons, wood chippers, forklifts, and tanning beds.","popularity":7.528,"poster_path":"/sRPlrapnPICLFPTHuPBSC3DWPCE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2011-04-27","episode_count":1,"id":18374,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/3SCYFBj9KmJ5SUYdwUQzhkYYFId.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2008-11-17","episode_count":17,"id":18365,"name":"Season
