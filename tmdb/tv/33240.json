He's disappointed not to be assigned to a fighter but to a freighter. His co-pilot, Lt. Coker Fasjovic, isn't too keen on having a rookie flying his aircraft as he has only a short time before he again becomes a civilian. Their cargo is a civilian scientist, Dr. Becca Kelly, but they no sooner leave than she has new orders for them and a new destination. She is less than forthcoming about just what her secret mission is but Adama is keen, particularly as it involves going into Cylon controlled space. Nothing is as it seems however.","popularity":11.083,"poster_path":"/fuHuvxnfcPXZauX1Pm7qwmc9k5L.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2013-02-10","episode_count":2,"id":44427,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/2IR4hNfzJ3TPWnqgeSrjEfZ4SpE.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2012-11-09","episode_count":10,"id":44428,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/vYcKJtQfS47DY4aXdyChEnwMC7m.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":5.5}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":6.662,"vote_count":145,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258a83a760ee346616bf205","air_date":"2012-11-09","episodes":[{"air_date":"2012-11-09","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":775294,"name":"Webisode 1","overview":"Ensign William Adama finds himself assigned to the newest Battlestar in the colonial fleet and a new callsign from his war weary co-pilot, Coker.","production_code":"","runtime":12,"season_number":1,"show_id":33240,"still_path":"/aNV9E3Q6A9BafgZifTmXIEXUgSu.jpg","vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-11-09","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":775295,"name":"Webisode 2","overview":"Adama and Coker's supply mission quickly turns lethal as the small crew pilots their Raptor through Cylon territory.","production_code":"","runtime":11,"season_number":1,"show_id":33240,"still_path":"/9cS4caODLTvaHsOcUZbgUiZXkal.jpg","vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-11-16","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":775296,"name":"Webisode 3","overview":"Reeling from the discovery of the ruins of Battlestar Archeron, Adama and Coker’s small Raptor is nearly outmatched when they engage with three enemy Raiders.
