But when Lois is reduced to tears after being excluded from a group photo, the family rallies to her side with an all-out counterattack that turns the party into pandemonium.","production_code":"06-02-403","runtime":22,"season_number":4,"show_id":2004,"still_path":"/iI5a80fwndlI2eg7tjZKGVIz6lX.jpg","vote_average":9.1,"vote_count":7,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52571e9619c2957114108e71","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":29009,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Ken Kwapis","original_name":"Ken Kwapis","popularity":3.855,"profile_path":"/ec57YfT1bN17GMDQNCbmWGv4EUN.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52571e8c19c2957114108557","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224235,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alex Reid","original_name":"Alex Reid","popularity":3.34,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"5f049c4a1d1bf40036615a1a","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51854,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Steve Welch","original_name":"Steve Welch","popularity":0.84,"profile_path":"/twpSHzffgQnoDfODN2de0G7lJUF.jpg"},{"job":"Stunt Double","department":"Crew","credit_id":"5f084d101d1bf4003766af6e","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1929310,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Shawn Crowder","original_name":"Shawn Crowder","popularity":1.907,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","credit_id":"5f049c14bb070d003705a44e","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":58049,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Levie Isaacks","original_name":"Levie Isaacks","popularity":2.564,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Stunt Coordinator","department":"Crew","credit_id":"5f049aab1d1bf40037615a11","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":18677,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bobby Porter","original_name":"Bobby Porter","popularity":1.357,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Walter","credit_id":"52571e9619c2957114108f29","order":513,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1062,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Christopher Lloyd","original_name":"Christopher Lloyd","popularity":36.054,"profile_path":"/nxVjpyb3UrfbPZnEyDNlQVlFAs5.jpg"},{"character":"Amelia","credit_id":"52571e9619c2957114108f59","order":637,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":101396,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brenda Strong","original_name":"Brenda Strong","popularity":10.684,"profile_path":"/jMfkFmQT2zgTojkcmn67Fju3HU.jpg"},{"character":"Claire","credit_id":"5f417a0f99d5c30035b47a31","order":1044,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":152355,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jeanine Jackson","original_name":"Jeanine Jackson","popularity":3.631,"profile_path":"/6iSzrw7jIqZZgSZLfkwRdQkKl3H.jpg"},{"character":"Tom","credit_id":"5f417a310bb0760031d24fe1","order":1045,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":86475,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Robert Alan Beuth","original_name":"Robert Alan Beuth","popularity":1.839,"profile_path":"/jewxIcZhDjTrBqeSdqj7jSACKfV.jpg"},{"character":"Pete","credit_id":"5f417a583bd26e0035850f52","order":1046,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1215974,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Valdetero","original_name":"John Valdetero","popularity":1.745,"profile_path":"/tiCtbYEPKszgL6dNyNar3Kwswdk.jpg"},{"character":"Jesus / Therapist","credit_id":"5f417a8de8999b00324bbfdd","order":1047,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1236639,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Knudsen","original_name":"Matt Knudsen","popularity":2.433,"profile_path":"/kFjWUxJY4bXLt73ISSPM6vHa0M7.jpg"},{"character":"Trevor","credit_id":"5f417aa699d5c3003ab48910","order":1048,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2751663,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Timmy Fitzpatrick","original_name":"Timmy Fitzpatrick","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Sammy","credit_id":"5f417ad047721500335f2362","order":1049,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61984,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Benjamin Bryan","original_name":"Benjamin Bryan","popularity":1.548,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Photographer","credit_id":"5f417ae799d5c30035b47adc","order":1050,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2751665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Andrew J.

As a form of repayment, Malcolm gets great seats for him and Lois to see Lois' favorite singer. Lois then gets lucky and is invited backstage where all she really wants to do is figure out why Malcolm doesn't want her around.\n\nHal, on the other hand, is looking all across Las Vegas for a slot
