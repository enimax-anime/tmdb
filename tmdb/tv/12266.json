It ran from September 9 to December 2, 1978 for NBC. The show also appeared on BBC in the United Kingdom. It contained the following four segments:\n\n⁕Yogi's Space Race: intergalactic racing competitions with Yogi Bear, Jabberjaw, Huckleberry Hound and several new characters.\n\n⁕Galaxy Goof-Ups: Yogi Bear, Scare Bear, Huckleberry Hound and Quack-Up as four intergalactic police officers and their leader, Captain Snerdley.\n\n⁕The Buford Files: Buford is a lazy bloodhound who solves mysteries in Fenokee County with two teenagers, Cindy Mae and Woody.\n\n⁕The Galloping Ghost: Nugget Nose is a ghost miner who is a guardian to Wendy and Rita, two teenage cowgirls who work at the Fuddy Dude Ranch.\n\nWhen Galaxy Goof-Ups was given its own half-hour timeslot on November 4, 1978, Yogi's Space Race was reduced to 60 minutes; in early 1979, the \"Space Race\" segment and Buford and the Galloping Ghost were also spun off in their own half-hour series until September 1979.\n\nThe series was later aired in reruns on the USA Cartoon Express, Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, and Boomerang.","popularity":4.896,"poster_path":"/em4REgLz33OxAEIhfoNTXWEjMoK.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":1353,"logo_path":"/yXhCcOFK5Fy3ZBQwhBYx8Zu9ZIw.png","name":"Hanna-Barbera
