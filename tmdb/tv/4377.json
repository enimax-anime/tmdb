The hacker's sister Janet is a friend of Amanda's and the duo get involved. Nick tracks a back-up CD to the Immortal, whom Amanda recognizes as Payton, an astrologer, poisoner, and stage magician who ran afoul of Amanda centuries earlier. Payton assaults Nick and then escapes with a poisoned-smoke grenade, giving the detective 22 hours to live. He'll give Nick the antidote if they stay out of his affairs. Amanda gets hold of the 10 million Payton was stealing, and Payton kidnaps Janet in return. They arrange to make a deal, and Amanda engages Payton in combat. He tries to trick her using a holographic projector but a dying Nick destroys it, giving Amanda the advantage. She suffers a rather bizarre Quickening as she flashes back over her life, and her encounters with Nick. Going to him, she asks for forgiveness and shoots him dead before the poison kills him. He wakes up immortal.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"1999-05-22","episode_number":22,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":4377,"still_path":"/sjMtRtplZsR8Ma74eDK95hdCn8g.jpg"},"name":"Highlander: The Raven","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syndication","origin_country":"US"}],"number_of_episodes":22,"number_of_seasons":1,"origin_country":["US","CA"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Highlander: The Raven","overview":"Highlander: The Raven was a short-lived spin-off from the television series Highlander, continuing the saga of a female Immortal.

Amanda arrives just in time to get the Quickening, leaving Nick to lament what might have been.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":4377,"still_path":"/5tt9OHrj9AOYtiDs4CRSyyQa562.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52576653760ee36aaa37b6b7","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":105294,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"George Mendeluk","original_name":"George Mendeluk","popularity":1.116,"profile_path":"/hUuc10huzcdYOtIW6VoV32TZxaA.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52576652760ee36aaa37b519","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1213938,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Karen Harris","original_name":"Karen Harris","popularity":2.721,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Dr. Julian Heller","credit_id":"52576657760ee36aaa37ba51","order":511,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":5473,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Julian Wadham","original_name":"Julian Wadham","popularity":8.612,"profile_path":"/xV74ywhz6EjjD8yp4VMUIAVuuKJ.jpg"},{"character":"Man","credit_id":"52576657760ee36aaa37ba7f","order":530,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19362,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Rioufol","original_name":"Marc Rioufol","popularity":1.355,"profile_path":"/enJ8oezwF2XLFlvnDl50D2G6X9W.jpg"},{"character":"Lauren Wolfe","credit_id":"60bd8cdb244182004203ed1e","order":612,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1765977,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rochelle Redfield","original_name":"Rochelle Redfield","popularity":3.855,"profile_path":"/hU54xYjZ33AmGqWCiwseYOr03q3.jpg"},{"character":"Susanne","credit_id":"60bd8cef9a64c1002994fdfe","order":613,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":136813,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Elisabeth Kaza","original_name":"Elisabeth Kaza","popularity":2.122,"profile_path":"/6Y9dXdVAC7L9G10iiRhAcAC3Q6z.jpg"},{"character":"Spencer","credit_id":"60bd8cfd960cde00562a689a","order":614,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1402273,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Patrick Albenque","original_name":"Patrick Albenque","popularity":2.05,"profile_path":"/117jgZncTHHrLKeCT1cRWKR44xi.jpg"},{"character":"Sergeant","credit_id":"60bd8d0ceb79c20040b0649c","order":615,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38891,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Michel Albertini","original_name":"Michel Albertini","popularity":1.287,"profile_path":"/1tolmrmOSZ5ecKrfDMGz25HyU3J.jpg"},{"character":"Jerry","credit_id":"60bd8d17b0460500295e0d7e","order":616,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3047665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dirk Bromley","original_name":"Dirk Bromley","popularity":1.108,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Soldier #1","credit_id":"60bd8dc9eb79c20040b06624","order":617,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2454634,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Didier Kersten","original_name":"Didier Kersten","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Helena","credit_id":"60bd8deaaf95900040e23b6d","order":618,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2749047,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Veronica Antico","original_name":"Veronica Antico","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Pascal","credit_id":"60bd89aa05a53300407ecd2e","order":619,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1758263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Marc Pierret","original_name":"Marc Pierret","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":"1999-05-15","episode_number":21,"episode_type":"standard","id":302840,"name":"War and Peace","overview":"A reporter interviewing Father Liam spots Amanda being killed and resurrecting. Amanda was fighting Sean, an Immortal who has sworn vengeance on Liam for killing his adopted mother during the Revolutionary War. This event drove Liam to become a priest, which he promised to do if the mother pulled through. She didn't but Amanda lied to him. Now Liam finds out the truth from her, and gives himself up to Sean and his motorcycle gang of Immortals. Despite Nick and Amanda's attempts to protect Father Liam, he refuses to defend himself against Sean, who relents. The reporter witnesses all of this, but realizes no one will believe her...at least, until she writes up the events as a fictional novel.

The hacker's sister Janet is a friend of Amanda's and the duo get involved. Nick tracks a back-up CD to the Immortal, whom Amanda recognizes as Payton, an astrologer, poisoner, and stage magician who ran afoul of Amanda centuries earlier. Payton assaults Nick and then escapes with a poisoned-smoke grenade, giving the detective 22 hours to live. He'll give Nick the antidote if they stay out of his affairs. Amanda gets hold of the 10 million Payton was stealing, and Payton kidnaps Janet in return. They arrange to make a deal, and Amanda engages Payton in combat. He tries to trick her using a holographic projector but a dying Nick destroys it, giving Amanda the advantage. She suffers a rather bizarre Quickening as she flashes back over her life, and her encounters with Nick. Going to him, she asks for forgiveness and shoots him dead before the poison kills him.
