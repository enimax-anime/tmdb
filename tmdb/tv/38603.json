As Lord En is a huge fan of games and the like, he is drawn to the game centres and amusement parks there and is distracted from his original mission of destroying humanity. During the visit to Ishiyama Land it's found that he cries very easily over the slightest things that BabyBeel does or happens in general. He suggests going on a roller coaster, which everyone is against due to his crying, but still he demands to go on. He does eventually end up crying and creating fire once again on the roller coaster.
