Tyson is close to his family, but after living on his own, he now feels a little closed in. So, although it's customary for children in Costa Rica to live with their families until they marry, he is breaking tradition and searching for a space to call his own. He's hoping to find a place with two bedrooms and a view that is close to his parents' home, but he knows that with a budget equivalent to $150,000, he'll probably be limited to buying a condominium. With his family's blessing--and their input--the search is on. Real estate Agent Edward Fridovich signs on to help.",

They are ready to buy a home but don't exactly agree on where. Evan wants to be as close to their restaurant in the city center as he can get, while Maria-Isabel is seeking a quieter, possibly more distant refuge. They both agree on size: 2 bedrooms plus an office, and on style: they like historic homes, and appreciate architectural authenticity. They also like to entertain and would like a hip space to do so. Real Estate Agent Sean Dennis shows them an historic home in the heart of town. Evan and Maria-Isabel love the home's authentic details and view of the cathedral, but Maria-Isabel is concerned about noise. Next Sean shows them a Colonial Reproduction a few minutes outside the center of town.",

Christopher and Tracy have a budget of $700,000 for a home that's a fractional and $2.5 million for one that they can own fully. They check out two fractionals: one that is available for $700,000 and offers an 8 week stay and the other is priced at $500,000 for a 10 week stay.",

In Panama, real estage agent Fatima de la Guardia shows them three gorgeous homes, each more luxurious than the next. The first is priced at 1.1 million dollars, but lacks a pool.

They'd like a two or three bedroom, two bathroom condo that's fully furnished, with a nice patio or deck, and that is within walking distance to a beach. If they could score an actual water view, they'd be delighted. Their budget is $350,000 - $450,000, which actually won't go a very long way in St. Croix, so this could be tough. Sales Associate Kerry Waldo is ready for the challenge. The first place she shows them is listed for $379,000. It has three bedrooms and two large decks, but is far from the beach. The second condo, listed at $460,000, is just steps from the sand, but only has two bedrooms, which means the Katko boys would have to share a room.",

The active couple is especially fond of soaking up the sun and surfing the waves. When they got married they went on their honeymoon to San Juan Del Sur, a premier surf destination in Nicaragua known for its pristine beaches and amazing waves. They fell so in love with the coastal region that they've decided to buy a vacation home there. They're hoping to find a home that's near a surf beach and ideally falls within their $150,000 to $200,000 budget. Helping them find a home is their close personal friend and realtor, Brooke Rundle. The first place their pal shows them is a 900 square foot studio with amazing beach views and is listed for $185,000. The condo property is adjacent to a hotel that allows homeowners access to its restaurant and pool area. The second option is a 1600 square foot, two bedroom villa in a gated community that is listed for $200,000. Like the first property, this one is also near a hotel that allows homeowners access to its pool and restaurant. The final home they look at is two story home listed for $175,000. The 1500 square foot property has two bedrooms and is located right at a surf spot with fantastic views. Jesse and Kelly are just one decision away from a surf side vacation paradise in Nicaragua.",

That's a tough lifestyle for anyone, and especially tough for the parents of young children, like Phil and Amanda. With no formal training in home renovation, the couple has had to learn on the job, but they've enjoyed doing it, and have found it to be a profitable career. However, Amanda is tired of living in a construction zone and she's ready to buy a home that is ready-to-move into, and will be permanent for their young family of four. They want to stay in France's Languedoc-Roussillon region, and they want to find a grand home with plenty of local, historic character. Their only other request is for a large garden where the kids can play. Their budget is $512,000. Find out if they get what they want when House Hunters goes to France's Languedoc-Roussillon region.",
