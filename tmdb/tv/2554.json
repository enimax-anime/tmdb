Set in a mental asylum, it ran for one series of six episodes. Unlike traditional sitcoms or comedy television shows, it was to some extent an opportunity for stand-up routines by various comedians, mixed with an overall story involving much black humour. It is significant for involving a large number of British comedians, many who have gone on to work on some of the most successful comedy programmes of the last decade. It marked the first collaboration of Edgar Wright, Simon Pegg and Jessica Stevenson, who would go on to make cult sitcom Spaced. Many of the characters names were the same as those of the actors who portrayed them.\n\nDavid Devant & His Spirit Wife were the \"house band\" for the series, performing segments in every episode, from their first album, Work, Lovelife, Miscellaneous. The lead-in track \"Ginger\" served as the programme's title music.\n\nThe series has yet to be released on DVD; however, the full episodes are viewable on Norman Lovett's website.","popularity":2.203,"poster_path":"/yHjSbpAGSEwLlWxw7IJWLYQUKLC.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1996-01-22","episode_count":6,"id":8160,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/qjQVAaxbOn5qByrEqdbNpcLfyl1.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.6,"vote_count":8,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52573ce419c29531db04997c","air_date":"1996-01-22","episodes":[{"air_date":"1996-01-22","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":197926,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"Simon, a pizza delivery boy, arrives at a mental asylum to deliver a Beef Magic pizza and unwittingly becomes part of a twisted experiment.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":2554,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Patient","credit_id":"61568fa207e281008dae67ea","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1846163,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Paul Tonkinson","original_name":"Paul Tonkinson","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":null,"episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":197927,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"Julian takes Adam hostage, Martha talks to herself, and the whole group puts on a Christmas pageant.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":2554,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Patient / Doctor","credit_id":"61568fd0e18b97002c40a9ee","order":501,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1732966,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Moloney","original_name":"John Moloney","popularity":1.154,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":null,"episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":197928,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"After he is banned from juggling, Paul attempts an escape.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":2554,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Patient","credit_id":"61568ffeb513a8002ae232db","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":24265,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bill Bailey","original_name":"Bill Bailey","popularity":9.177,"profile_path":"/hA3vK90snmnt1xtuJR4Iac0YRXe.jpg"},{"character":"Duelling Guitarist","credit_id":"6156900fe18b97008c9bd578","order":503,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1812917,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Howard Haigh","original_name":"Howard Haigh","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":null,"episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":197929,"name":"Episode 4","overview":"Dr. Lovett is incapacitated by pills that he mistakes for sweeties, leaving Nurse McFadden in charge.
