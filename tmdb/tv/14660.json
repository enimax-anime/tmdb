The show aired as a week-long six-episode tournament at 8:00 PM from Monday through Friday with the finale on Sunday.\n\nThe show's website described the program as a cross between Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? and the World Series of Poker. The game was played in a head-to-head format in which contestants answered general trivia questions, with wrong answers contributing to a growing jackpot. The winner of the Duel jackpot of $1,720,000 was Ashlee Register, whose grand total was nearly $1.8 million when combined with previous winnings, making her the first highest female game show money winner in the U.S. at the time.\n\nThe second season aired in a weekly format with modified rules from April 4 to July 25, 2008 at 9:00 PM.","popularity":1.955,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2007-12-17","episode_count":6,"id":26148,"name":"(us) season
