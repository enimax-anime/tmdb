The series, produced by DIC Entertainment and originally airing on NBC, re-imagined Archie Andrews, Betty Cooper, Veronica Lodge, Jughead Jones, Reggie Mantle, and the other teenage students of Riverdale High School as pre-teens in junior high. Thirteen episodes of the show were produced, which all aired during the show's first and only season in 1987 and were repeated in 1989. A short-lived Archie Comics series was produced bearing the same title and set in the same universe as the animated series. Reruns of the series ran on The Family Channel's Saturday morning lineup, 1991 to 1993 and on Toon Disney from 1998 to 2002.","popularity":1.604,"poster_path":"/qTTdYj9WCdNWinSkATf3qNgagLk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":65721,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Archie Company","origin_country":""},{"id":20477,"logo_path":"/u0zjebYOFWdLcpR4hxE8o2zwHKQ.png","name":"DiC Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":2106,"logo_path":"/3ymjxYcUFEwCdMf2SoVyGd1aHef.png","name":"Saban Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1987-09-12","episode_count":13,"id":19646,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5257f7ba19c29531db2c5a91","air_date":"1987-09-12","episodes":[{"air_date":"1987-09-12","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":411477,"name":"The Visitor / Ballot Box Blues","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":9829,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":null,"episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":411485,"name":"The Last Laugh / Thief!
