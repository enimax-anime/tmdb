When he shows up at an address in Costa Mesa, he finds a Davis -- a three-wheeled, purple and silver four-seater reminiscent of an overgrown bumper car. Built in the Van Nuys during the late '40s and billed as a revolutionary new kind of car, the Davis was engineered with two wheels in the back, but only one in the front. Made from lightweight aluminum and powered by a V-8 engine, this offbeat car was originally priced to sell at $1,000. But before they could start the assembly line rolling, the creator, Gary Davis, was indicted for 28 counts of fraud and grand theft and sent to prison. The Davis factory was shut down after only 13 cars were completed. With the clock ticking, Wayne must decide if he'll buy this rare, but odd, car on the spot -- or be forced to walk away.",
