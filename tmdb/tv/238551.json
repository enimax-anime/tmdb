            "overview": "After waking from a century-long sleep, vampire Phum finds that the land of vampires has banned gen-x vampires from falling in love. The new law doesn't suit Phum and he invites his gang of close friends—Sen, Run, Mix and Jolie—to flee to the land of humans where people have more freedom. Getting there, however, won't be easy. They'll need to put their names down in the Book of Life and take the bodies of their parrellel human selves, mindful that there may be consequences.\n\nPhum finds himself living the life of a heartbroken young man. Life in the land of humans is turning out to be a chaotic undertaking when he meets Patrick, the owner of a secret bar, and ends up working for him.",
