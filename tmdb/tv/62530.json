They are not just off-the-grid, they are physically cut off from society by Rocky Mountains, roaring rivers and frozen tundra. But however self-sufficient...no man’s an island. Sooner or later, these off-gridders need a life-giving tool - like fuel or bullets - or a life-saving essential - like food or medicine. When they do, they turn to the cast of Dead End Express. By pack horse, dog sled, power boat, snow machine and bush plane this unique group of men risk all to deliver where no one else can or will. Delivering their payload is a matter of life or death, not just for their clients but for them, in their ongoing mission to survive and deliver.",
