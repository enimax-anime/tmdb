arrested just before Christmas and charged with stealing a famous jewel, the Blue Carbuncle, from Lady Morcar. He denies the theft - but he has a criminal record, and all the evidence is against him.  After Holmes's doorman finds the Carbuncle in a Christmas goose, Holmes uses an old hat to track the goose to a poultry dealer, then traps the servant who stole the jewel and framed the plumber.  The Blue Carbuncle has a dark history, and the stone features in the programme's opening credits with turbulent scenes from its past.","production_code":"","runtime":52,"season_number":1,"show_id":799,"still_path":"/7Wu7Jpu6QXifSLA637ywSsVwhYB.jpg","vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":4,"crew":[{"job":"Associate
