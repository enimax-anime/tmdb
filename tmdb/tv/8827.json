By the mid-1970s, Marty Stouffer had put together several full length documentaries. At this time, he approached the programming managers at Public Broadcasting Service about a half-hour-long wildlife show, the first to focus exclusively upon the flora and fauna of North America. PBS signed for the rights to broadcast Marty Stouffer's show Wild America in 1982. The show went on to become one of the most popular aired by PBS, renowned for its unflinching portrayal of nature, as well as its extensive use of film techniques such as slow motion and close-ups. Stouffer earned $135,000 per show from PBS.\n\nThe show's production ran from 1982 to 1994. The series is no longer on PBS; reruns still air in syndication on commercial television through much of the United States. In 1997, Warner Brothers released a full-length feature film entitled Wild America, which was based loosely on the biographical story of Marty Stouffer and his brothers, Mark and Marshall.","popularity":3.886,"poster_path":"/tkvfBl2KObuqpzcGwUy1r9hq2QH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1982-10-01","episode_count":10,"id":81684,"name":"Amazing & Unique Animals","overview":"Animals in America come in a fascinating variety of shapes and sizes; many have adaptations and behaviors that are absolutely incrediblle.
