He applies similar tactics to a diverse group of spouses, ranging from newlyweds to couples who have been together for decades. To allow the couples to escape any distractions from the daily grind of their lives, Taffer transports them to a five-star beach resort in the Caribbean to put them through a series of tests. After the tests, couples either leave the show together or opt to part ways.","popularity":1.753,"poster_path":"/1mLjxVKEyMYksdUeaM9Silmp1yX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26186,"logo_path":"/vtNy80cTERKwGvh0JknduL7Srgf.png","name":"3 Ball Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2019-06-02","episode_count":6,"id":125414,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/j3WObxYGYt0ecWv1yPaeibxFquZ.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Reality","vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5cf6c6dfc3a3685c08257d6a","air_date":"2019-06-02","episodes":[{"air_date":"2019-06-02","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1808407,"name":"Maybe You're Just a Horrible Wife","overview":"After trying conventional therapy and failing to see results, two couples struggling to regain trust after infidelity turn to Jon Taffer to save their marriages.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":90042,"still_path":"/6Yh1zivjliC7XjrMh74OqxN3nL5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-06-09","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1822454,"name":"You Married a Fool!","overview":"Jon attempts to help two couples caught in power struggles find balance and decide whether they're ready to mend their marriages or walk away for good.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":90042,"still_path":"/lTZ1GORnRHOowBFgZ6E7cw2ayck.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-06-16","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1822455,"name":"Your Wife Thinks You're Boring","overview":"A wife suspects her husband is guilty of gambling and lying; a couple deals with changes in their relationship after one of them becomes sober.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":90042,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-06-23","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":2945821,"name":"No Integrity","overview":"Newlyweds deal with resentments over career drive and financial instability; a couple deal with the aftermath of an affair.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":90042,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-06-30","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":2945822,"name":"You Guys Are Screwed","overview":"Avoidance issues in a marriage, and a partner's addiction to social media are leading two couples toward divorce.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":90042,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-07-07","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"finale","id":2945823,"name":"You're a Freakin' Liar","overview":"A couple struggles to regain their connection after a threesome gone wrong, and another struggles with suspicions of infidelity.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":90042,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":125414,"poster_path":"/j3WObxYGYt0ecWv1yPaeibxFquZ.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
