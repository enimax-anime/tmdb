record department in his shop is a popular spot for the local lads and when Blaketon and Nick both receive anonymous tip offs accusing Denby of having 'an unhealthy interest in young boys', rumours about him start to circulate. Blaketon is keen to get the matter sorted out weather its true or false and Nick goes to see Denby, and asks him about his private life. Denby however insists he's doing nothing wrong and just enjoys the lads company. Nick continues to keep an eye on Denby and locals tell him that he only seems to invite lads to his flat. Nick later then sees Denby arguing with local car dealer - Reg Pendleton, outside his shop and he begins to have more suspicions. Then when Kate is in Denby's shop, she witnesses another man called - Harry Cottis accusing Denby of assaulting his son. Blaketon then receives a call from the superintendent who's a mason like Denby, ordering that Denby to be bought in for questioning.

Rex is the lead tenor in the choir to whom the leader of the choir, Miriam has taken a fancy. Rex asks her to sack Alf from the choir, and she does, but soon asks him back when she sees Rex with someone else. Rex is beaten up outside the pub and his mother tells Nick that she thinks it was Alf who did it. Nick doesn't believe it but he has to find out what really happened. Rex eventually agrees to talk to the police and tells them it was Baxter. He got a lot of TV sets half price from Baxter (which were stolen), but they were faulty, so the customers wouldn't pay and he couldn't pay Baxter the money he owed him. Greengrass has trouble with a piece of Royal Dolton that Gina ordered for a Christmas present. Gina invites Mike to Christmas dinner, and Katie and Nick enjoy watching Jo perform in the choir.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":7,"show_id":2585,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"626e1f80eec4f3308e839c16","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2650218,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Peter Gibbs","original_name":"Peter Gibbs","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Stunt Coordinator","department":"Crew","credit_id":"626e1fdf38e5100052ff81ac","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":53587,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Diamond","original_name":"Peter Diamond","popularity":2.287,"profile_path":"/nVb4nFvWloTdzopD42aNV5osYKU.jpg"},{"job":"Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"627e2548caa5080067bc4f6c","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3547483,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"John Allen","original_name":"John Allen","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"6285f98d1a3248181a5b06e6","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2882864,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Anderson","original_name":"John Anderson","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Eileen Reynolds","credit_id":"625a3a9dd236e60066b1b02f","order":17,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":192842,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Stallybrass","original_name":"Anne Stallybrass","popularity":3.619,"profile_path":"/c34iVd9hdiEPc4V78uLZpAfuU5z.jpg"},{"character":"PC Mike Bradley","credit_id":"6285fe57ec455251286af204","order":18,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82808,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jason Durr","original_name":"Jason Durr","popularity":8.323,"profile_path":"/tnJGTrCYTJYXHT6WNw6GKU9XoKh.jpg"},{"character":"Maggie Bolton","credit_id":"6259155f2a210c062b237d8b","order":20,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":953986,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kazia Pelka","original_name":"Kazia Pelka","popularity":4.665,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Miriam","credit_id":"52573d9519c29531db057529","order":549,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1232060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Katharine Rogers","original_name":"Katharine Rogers","popularity":2.089,"profile_path":"/jV6vZ9Be0Hs7B3PAx2S0XUIPyhV.jpg"},{"character":"Rex Hawkins","credit_id":"52573d9519c29531db057587","order":786,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":96279,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Con O'Neill","original_name":"Con O'Neill","popularity":26.485,"profile_path":"/7Fnj1dB9kStTuy29eEVK4IuOxWO.jpg"},{"character":"Betty Hawkins","credit_id":"62865998ec4552512688ac2b","order":1643,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":643171,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Helen Ryan","original_name":"Helen Ryan","popularity":2.309,"profile_path":"/ad2e0mxVGaCfiIITqMcejtRlzwe.jpg"},{"character":"Neville","credit_id":"62865a968c22c0005120fad4","order":1644,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2801560,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Chris Larner","original_name":"Chris Larner","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Sylvia","credit_id":"62865b1f1a32481bd60f3815","order":1645,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1246239,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Fionnuala Ellwood","original_name":"Fionnuala Ellwood","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Lol","credit_id":"62865ba20d5d851db2a2ac92","order":1646,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2626736,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Heap","original_name":"Richard Heap","popularity":1.166,"profile_path":"/gS5sjquNoMCoRZAhRh3biLdBQiv.jpg"},{"character":"Brodie","credit_id":"62865bed0d5d851db10b4fe7","order":1647,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1565168,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Flanagan","original_name":"John Flanagan","popularity":5.862,"profile_path":"/zLSndZShO8dkHiNMhcs9fF6iNVQ.jpg"},{"character":"Lorry Driver","credit_id":"62865c3a1f3e60009b7203ac","order":1648,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2660356,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steve Whyment","original_name":"Steve Whyment","popularity":2.36,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Customer","credit_id":"62865c911a32481bd528f312","order":1649,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3555788,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gloria Appleton","original_name":"Gloria Appleton","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Customer","credit_id":"62865ce81f3e60009b7205dd","order":1650,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3555791,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Toni Lloyd","original_name":"Toni Lloyd","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Sgt.
