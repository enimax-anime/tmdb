It still happens today. As recently as November 29, 2012, David Mitchell, a Scottish farmer, found one of his sheep slaughtered with surgical precision, its heart, lungs and liver laid out meticulously on the hillside and a pair of surgical gloves lying next to the remains. Curse of the Ice Mummy- In September 1991, a couple was hiking in the Alps near the Austrian-Italian border when they suddenly noticed a skeleton poking out of the ice. It was the body of what appeared to be a perfectly preserved warrior, complete with fur robes, leather shoes and a bow and arrow. Scientists studying the body dubbed it the Iceman. The Iceman is one of the oldest preserved bodies ever found and has provided us with invaluable information about mankind's past. But many involved in the excavation of the body have unexpectedly died - could the remains be cursed, putting everyone who touches the body at risk?","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":61509,"still_path":"/sD3eKlPIaRydtrRMPa73rY9ejM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-09-11","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1011947,"name":"Freaky Fires & Ghost Yacht","overview":"In late 2003, in a small village in northern Sicily, ordinary household electronic items like refrigerators, toasters and televisions suddenly began bursting into flames and exploding seemingly at random. Air conditioners erupted even when unplugged. Computers jammed. Cellphones rang when no one was calling and electronic door locks in empty cars went demonically up and down. The mystery was left unsolved. Ghost Yacht- The Kaz II, dubbed the ghost yacht, is a catamaran, which was found drifting 88 nautical miles off the northern coast of Australia on April 18, 2007. The fate of her three-man crew remains unknown, and the mysterious circumstances in which they disappeared still puzzle authorities, family and friends.

A local mayor has recorded hundreds of UFOs over 20 years. In 1995 one crashed into a nearby mountain range- local pilot Tony Galvagno and his friends locate the crash site but are barred from investigating further. In 2009, 200 witnesses see a brilliant white shining craft in the sky. Some onlookers manage to take photos of it before the town is plunged into darkness. The power outage stretches over a 120-mile area and lasts for over 12 hours. Could alien visitors really be targeting the town? And if so, why? Mothman- On November 15, 1966, four people witnessed a huge winged creature as they sat in their cars on the outskirts of Point Pleasant, West Virginia. It was six to seven feet tall with red eyes and no head, as if the eyes were in its chest. Over the next 13 months more than 100 others saw the creature. The winged creature became known as The Mothman and was seen as a harbinger of doom. Morgellon's Disease- Sufferers of this strange disease report fatigue, awful skin lesions, aches and pains, a sensation that insects are crawling under their skin and odd multi-colored fibers emerging from their bodies. Thousands of people around the world believe they have Morgellon's, but the disease does not officially exist! The majority of doctors regard it as a form of delusional infestation, but some sufferers of the disease believe it could have extraterrestrial origins.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":61509,"still_path":"/qEJVrFq3JoibOaWHqY2l9NWVm1t.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2013-09-25","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":1011949,"name":"Alien Blood Rain, Carolina Beach Boom & Voynich Manuscript","overview":"There are many areas around the world where rainwater has turned a disturbing shade of red.

Investigation proves that Carlos was neither intoxicated or under the influence of durgs and the actual 18-minute recording of his desperate Mayday call to the airport attests to his genuine panic.
