We follow the group as they navigate the greasy world of nugget vending under the watchful gaze of Mary, their eternally optimistic but desperately ineffectual branch manager. Her job is coveted by bitter assistant manager Derek, who's been working at the restaurant \"since it were a Wimpy\". Then there's geeky teenager Joe, who only has eyes for Amara; and the man who's decided they're best friends - foul-mouthed and relentlessly self-absorbed Ed; and the older, always riled Shontal. Every week the team have to deal with the customers, each other and the indelible smell of oil.","popularity":1.663,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":3625,"logo_path":null,"name":"Bwark Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2015-08-25","episode_count":6,"id":70102,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/gnY84Pxe84C8aBIzy3NhQXN1tWw.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":12,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"55e3c5b692514137e300265d","air_date":"2015-08-25","episodes":[{"air_date":"2015-08-25","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1102631,"name":"Carlos from Spain","overview":"Having learned that there have been complaints about her Mary, manageress of the Croydon Specially Fried Chicken branch goes undercover disguised as new employee Carlos and discovers the complainant to be Derek, the envious assistant manager who wants her job.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":63810,"still_path":"/kC3waB424fbJGqDuUJxqiHgCQ0B.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2015-09-01","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1102632,"name":"Hold Up","overview":"A late-night hold-up at knife point forces Seriously Fried Chicken manager Mary Fawn to question her managerial skills.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":63810,"still_path":"/aeKFxaun1csb6CYVKC1nijXMQli.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2015-09-08","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1102633,"name":"Poulet Etc","overview":"A rival fried chicken vendor threatens to send Seriously Fried Chicken out of business.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":63810,"still_path":"/vUcwrp8XBLwoS7DEEvcMkwUO90z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2015-09-15","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":1102634,"name":"The Second Coming","overview":"Ed finds a nugget that maybe looks a bit like Jesus while Derek recruits a local busker to help him recapture his glory days.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":63810,"still_path":"/nPSkd4s7oInpo4MbEmGE5EnM6Vt.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2015-09-22","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":1102635,"name":"The Chicken Awards","overview":"It's the fifth annual Seriously Fried Chicken Awards and Mary has her eye on the Most Improved Restaurant Award.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":63810,"still_path":"/e0OTzcvEVJUifeWYxzqYAF21yhS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2015-09-29","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"finale","id":1102636,"name":"In the Beginning","overview":"The story of how Mary Fawn came to be the manager of Seriously Fried Chicken, Croydon.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":63810,"still_path":"/f3NB2L75yEXZMXg6WGlPlLpGSy0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":70102,"poster_path":"/gnY84Pxe84C8aBIzy3NhQXN1tWw.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
