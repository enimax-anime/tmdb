Through examination of newly released body camera footage from a police raid in his murder investigation, the program looks at where his case stands today and why so many conspiracy theories exist about his death. The program features interviews with Leila Steinberg, Shakur’s first manager; Danyel Smith, former music journalist and friend of Shakur; Chris Carroll, a police officer who responded to the scene the night of Shakur’s shooting; and reporters who followed Shakur’s career closely, including Cathy Scott and Kevin Powell, who touch on Shakur’s enduring legacy on hip-hop and American culture. Are police any closer to solving one of pop culture’s most mysterious unsolved murders?",
