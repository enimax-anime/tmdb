On the run from a foster home, teenager Jade shares a squat with her controlling boyfriend Drew but dreams of a better life. She announces that she’s going to school at Waterloo Road and despite his fear the authorities will find out about them, Drew is persuaded to enroll too. Michael and Sian arrive at the new Waterloo Road. The local press reaction to the school has been largely positive, except one story reporting discontent from Gerard Findlay, headmaster of rival school Havelock High, who claims Waterloo Road are stealing his pupils. The school is buzzing as Jade and Drew arrive. Despite not being registered at Waterloo Road Drew uses his charisma to win Lorraine over – but it’s not long before Tom sees an angry side to the new boy. When Michael offers Jade, but not Drew, accommodation in the school house, Drew reacts angrily, forcing his girlfriend to reveal a secret which will have far-reaching consequences for the pair. In the staffroom, new teachers Christine Mulgrew and Audrey McFall introduce themselves to Waterloo Road’s familiar faces. Not everyone is enthusiastic about the new school and Tom bemoans Michael’s regime. But English teacher Christine doesn’t seem keen to be drawn into any staff discussions, keeping herself to herself. It’s only when Grantly suggests the teaching team go for a drink after school that Christine’s interest is spiked. Elsewhere, Tariq struggles to adjust to his new life as a paraplegic and Rhiannon starts a bullying campaign against Scout.",

Distressed following another heated argument with her over-bearing Uncle Lionel, Lulu runs to the sanctuary of her school but her behaviour irks the other pupils and gives the teachers cause for concern. Matters come to a head at Denzil’s commemorative ceremony when Lula lashes out at Imogen and Sian. Far from being apologetic, Lula makes some unsettling comments about death. And later, she has a run in with Tariq, hurtfully suggesting his disability is a punishment from God. Tom speaks to Lula’s uncle Lionel. But when Lula hears this she tells Tom her uncle plans to perform an exorcism on her believing she’s possessed. Terrified, she begs Tom to help her. Elsewhere Connor bugs his mother to lay off the alcohol but is met with Christine’s usual hostility. Playing up in class, Connor attempts to shame Christine but it backfires and he’s humiliated in front of his classmates. Concerned, Imogen tells Connor he can’t look after his mother forever – advice which spurs Connor to take drastic action. Grantly is furious when his car is vandalised by Havelock kids but Michael wants to keep the peace and not involve the police. But while Michael attempts to build bridges with rival headteacher Gerard Findlay, Grantly can’t help but rock the boat.
