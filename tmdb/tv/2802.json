On the run from a foster home, teenager Jade shares a squat with her controlling boyfriend Drew but dreams of a better life. She announces that sheâ€™s going to school at Waterloo Road and despite his fear the authorities will find out about them, Drew is persuaded to enroll too. Michael and Sian arrive at the new Waterloo Road. The local press reaction to the school has been largely positive, except one story reporting discontent from Gerard Findlay, headmaster of rival school Havelock High, who claims Waterloo Road are stealing his pupils. The school is buzzing as Jade and Drew arrive. Despite not being registered at Waterloo Road Drew uses his charisma to win Lorraine over â€“ but itâ€™s not long before Tom sees an angry side to the new boy. When Michael offers Jade, but not Drew, accommodation in the school house, Drew reacts angrily, forcing his girlfriend to reveal a secret which will have far-reaching consequences for the pair. In the staffroom, new teachers Christine Mulgrew and Audrey McFall introduce themselves to Waterloo Roadâ€™s familiar faces. Not everyone is enthusiastic about the new school and Tom bemoans Michaelâ€™s regime. But English teacher Christine doesnâ€™t seem keen to be drawn into any staff discussions, keeping herself to herself. Itâ€™s only when Grantly suggests the teaching team go for a drink after school that Christineâ€™s interest is spiked. Elsewhere, Tariq struggles to adjust to his new life as a paraplegic and Rhiannon starts a bullying campaign against Scout.",

Distressed following another heated argument with her over-bearing Uncle Lionel, Lulu runs to the sanctuary of her school but her behaviour irks the other pupils and gives the teachers cause for concern. Matters come to a head at Denzilâ€™s commemorative ceremony when Lula lashes out at Imogen and Sian. Far from being apologetic, Lula makes some unsettling comments about death. And later, she has a run in with Tariq, hurtfully suggesting his disability is a punishment from God. Tom speaks to Lulaâ€™s uncle Lionel. But when Lula hears this she tells Tom her uncle plans to perform an exorcism on her believing sheâ€™s possessed. Terrified, she begs Tom to help her.
