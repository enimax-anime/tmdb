The accident set Pamela off on a mission to try to discover the crucial factors which enable some individuals to overcome extraordinary trauma and still lead fulfilling lives in circumstances which would crush most of us. She hoped to find clues which would help her daughter’s recovery.\n\nShe met Allana and Mark in the course of her search and was immediately struck by the power of their experiences and the strength of their characters.\n\nAllana was left with paraplegia after a horrific light plane crash in her early twenties. She had to battle fear of flying and severe physical handicaps but has gone on to gain her commercial chopper pilot’s license. She is now in the middle of a solo flight around Australia.\n\nA diving accident at the age of sixteen left Mark Bashaw with complete quadriplegia. That means he is paralysed from the neck down with only a little limited movement in his arms. Despite incredible physical limitations Mark has managed a marriage, a highly successful business career and at the age of forty, is IBM’s international marketing manager for Australia and New Zealand. He went for the job without disclosing his handicap.\n\nThese are stories to rival the saga of Janice Shepherd as recounted in her best selling books “Never Tell Me Never” and “Dare to Fly”.",

He rose to national prominence late last year when he defied police rules and disclosed explosive allegations that the Catholic Church had consistently covered up the crimes of paedophile priests in the Newcastle-Hunter region of NSW. The decision to speak out occurred on the spur of the moment during an emotional public forum. Fox says he thought at the time that the consequences would be 'fairly heavy'. But he walked onto the public stage anyway, and addressed hundreds of abuse victims and their supporters. Other appearances followed and within weeks, the Prime Minister announced a far-reaching Royal Commission into the sexual abuse of children in institutions. Fox, along with others, is credited with helping to trigger it. Call Of Duty features exclusive footage of Peter Fox at the meeting that changed his life.",

What is less well known is the detail of the psychological struggles she navigated on the road to the London Olympics. Her ascendancy in her sport came at some cost to personal and family relationships. As a consequence of Anna's rise, her sister's dreams were crushed. And then there were her famous on and off track battles with the British favourite Victoria Pendleton which soon became the stuff of tabloid legend. From the UK, Pendleton provides candid new insights into the intense rivalry with Meares. And for the first time, Anna Meares reveals her own inside story.",

He was one of a family of eleven children born to an itinerant, violent and alcoholic sheep shearer.\n\nFarleigh and several of his older siblings were removed by Welfare authorities to an orphanage and he was subsequently fostered.\n\nInitially diagnosed as 'backward', his luck changed when a school teacher recognised his abilities and became 'the first person that I felt really cared about me'.\n\nHe excelled at maths and tournament chess and by his mid-thirties was a multi-millionaire business entrepreneur, moving to the UK five years ago.\n\nNow in his fifties, he has been back in Australia, retracing a past that he says continues to haunt him in ways he 'can't control'.",

Ronald Biggs was sentenced to 30 years gaol for his part in the crime that he once described as 'too good to refuse'. But behind the robbery and Biggs' subsequent escape to Australia, there's an epic saga of a woman's resilience and loyalty. Disowned by her middle class parents, Charmian Biggs and their two children, followed Biggs to Australia in the hope of a fresh start. It was the beginning of a tumultuous three decades marked by discoveries, escapes, betrayals and reunions. Forced to divorce her husband to help him avoid extradition from Brazil, Charmian Biggs raised her sons on her own and studied to obtain a university degree. She became a successful book editor under the new name of Brent. Then in 2001 Biggs finally surrendered to the British authorities so he could receive medical treatment.",

But it wasn't until he backed Julia Gillard's minority government in 2010 that he experienced widespread fallout – including death threats - from those who thought he'd abandoned his conservative New England electorate. From his vantage point in the Simpson Desert, far away from what he calls the 'greasy pond' of Canberra politics, Tony Windsor offers a final – and at times surprising - verdict on Canberra's political leaders.",
