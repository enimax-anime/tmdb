The show, produced by The Fred Silverman Company, Dean Hargrove Productions, Viacom Productions and Paramount Television originally aired from September 23, 1986 to May 8, 1992 on NBC; and from November 5, 1992 until May 7, 1995 on ABC.\n\nThe show's format is similar to that of CBS's Perry Mason, with Matlock identifying the perpetrators and then confronting them in dramatic courtroom scenes. One difference, however, was that whereas Mason usually exculpated his clients at a pretrial hearing, Matlock usually secured an acquittal at trial, from the jury.","popularity":295.949,"poster_path":"/2eGYyekQjcAXVmcYW1g4keR4plV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":12077,"logo_path":"/s6p5INYKlo6gD6RFXlm9ACA2VVj.png","name":"Viacom Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":56689,"logo_path":"/l97Fx8D6qNfrkC50mxVt5ONossk.png","name":"Dean Hargrove Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":56690,"logo_path":"/5cEgzWHzPriA6ZSNaZWkqJqi2UU.png","name":"Fred Silverman Company","origin_country":"US"},{"id":69270,"logo_path":null,"name":"The Matlock Company","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1986-03-03","episode_count":24,"id":6369,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/hZpxbr4BZKq4avexbTZlsjiDGOn.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":10},{"air_date":"1987-09-22","episode_count":24,"id":6367,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/ooNIy8cx28KZJdDbXSOa4qyc5z3.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1988-11-29","episode_count":20,"id":6365,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/73AgzNPDchwcy62FyRbnjSb1IBd.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1989-09-19","episode_count":24,"id":6366,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/8JFdNDwMg5bffBqX3AcsQfUnJQK.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1990-09-18","episode_count":22,"id":6364,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/3FHZY109c5cWJZfDVYLo1R0muIq.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1991-10-18","episode_count":22,"id":6368,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":"/cTpzADJ4qUWXROgICI2zYzAZmc8.jpg","season_number":6,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1992-11-05","episode_count":18,"id":6370,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":"/dyt4LG0U9C9LiYo54tRnZz96Ijm.jpg","season_number":7,"vote_average":10},{"air_date":"1993-09-23","episode_count":22,"id":6371,"name":"Season 8","overview":"","poster_path":"/hKHJrehG2srjoucR4Ho9K4jEuvK.jpg","season_number":8,"vote_average":9.1},{"air_date":"1994-10-13","episode_count":18,"id":6372,"name":"Season 9","overview":"","poster_path":"/z5lDwWQQe4cdoP5Wbwf1rWCA5K3.jpg","season_number":9,"vote_average":10}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.382,"vote_count":85,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5257219c760ee3776a20c6c8","air_date":"1986-03-03","episodes":[{"air_date":"1986-03-03","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":145765,"name":"Diary of a Perfect Murder","overview":"Atlanta lawyer Ben Matlock takes on the high profile case of a television reporter accused of murdering his former wife.
