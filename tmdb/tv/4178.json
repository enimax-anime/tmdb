Two and a half million people will visit Bondi over the next few months - up to 50,000 people on any one-day. The season gets off to a dramatic start as race riots on nearby Cronulla Beach threaten to spill over to Bondi. A shark scare only adds to the drama. For a while the beach is bizarrely quiet, then all hell breaks loose when nineteen year-old Natalie suddenly collapses in the water for no apparent reason. Her rescue and hospitalisation is a major incident on Bondi.(Summary from Ten.com.au - Permission granted)",

They know that tourists, alcohol and surf are a dangerous mix. With at least 10,000 overseas travellers due on the beach the Lifeguards expect to be flat out rescuing revellers who will have been drinking since mid-morning. Irish tourist Michelle is more than a little embarrassed when chief lifeguard Hoppo rescues her from the water.\n\nMeanwhile a teenager has broken his arm in the nearby skate ramp. Getting him out proves a difficult problem.(Summary from Ten.com.au - Permission granted)",

The Lifeguards are flat out on New Years Day as they attend drug and alcohol affected partygoers on the beach. An ecstacy overdose and a surfer�s severely dislocated shoulder are among the most serious cases. To make matters worse Bondi experiences one of the hottest days on record as the thermometer hovers above 45 degrees and everyone wilts in the heat. A line of ambulances are called down to the beach. But the heat doesn�t stop the thieves?(Summary from Ten.com.au - Permission granted)",

Not having seen him go under and with no friends, family, or witnesses forthcoming, lifeguards can�t be sure anyone is actually missing - with 20,000 people still needing to be monitored, the search is called off after 45 minutes.Yet at the end of the day, when the sun sets and lifeguards pack up, a 16 year old boy approaches with information his father has been missing for 2 hours, immediately their worst fears are realised.For everyone who visits the beach, this special episode of Bondi Rescue highlights the need for all beach goers to be aware of the dangers posed by the ocean.(Summary from Ten.com.au - Permision Granted)",

For lifeguards it’s the busiest time of the year, as they gear up for holiday crowds, heat waves, and drunken revellers. \n\nThe Bondi summer hits overdrive when hordes of reckless teenagers pour onto the beach and into the surf. With so many kids and so few lifeguards it isn’t long before tragedy strikes. 18 year old Stephanie was swimming with friends when she hit her head on a sandbank. She is pulled from the water unconscious, and not breathing. Immediately lifeguards begin resuscitating her.\n\nThe dangers of the surf are also experienced by a beginner surfer from England who is washed up the rocks, breaking his ankle in two places. With lifeguards already overstretched, two men make matters worse by pretending to drowning in front of Deano while he is doing a rescue. Police are called to escort them off the beach.\n\nThe silly season brings all and sundry to Bondi. When a man in a three-piece wedding suit (complete with tails), is found roaming the sand drinking, smoking, and harassing beachgoers he too finds himself red carded from Bondi until he is sobered up.\n\nIf the early stages of summer are anything to go by, lifeguards Whippet, Deano, Hoppo and Box are all in for a busy season. But the boys in blue wouldn’t want it any other way. Bondi is back in all it’s glory, madness, and brilliance!",

Now a new trainee is on the block, and Max now faces a do-or-die season. His rival Jake Nolan, is also one of his best mates - the two of them surf and train together, as well as hang-out after hours.\n\nWhen Head lifeguard Hoppo gives them the hard and fast facts that there can only be one man left standing at the end of he year, the relationship quickly changes, and the race begins!\n\nMaxy's opening gambit is the rescue of an uncle and daughter from Mauritius. Jake replies with a rescue in the southern corner of the beach.\n\nMeanwhile the rest of the team stay busy dealing with a 3 pronged onslaught; a British tourist with a dislocated shoulder, a Sydney events organiser with a suspected spinal injury, and a flurry of people stung by blue bottles. Then in true Bondi style - lifeguards spot Hugh Grant walking past the lifeguard tower.\n\nMaxy and Jake have little time to take notice, as they demonstrate their skills to senior lifeguards. Their commitment is commendable, but they should keep in mind it's a long season ahead on Bondi Beach.",

On Wednesday the 20th of January, an intense low pressure system between New Zealand and Tasmania dispatched giant waves to Bondi and surrounding beaches. Lifeguards immediately went into action corralling swimmers into the safest areas of the beach, but the intensity of the waves – which reached up to 15 feet in height – eventually forced them to close the beach for the first time in 12 years.\n\nAs temperatures reached 33 degrees, swimmers refused to obey lifeguards and swam at their own peril. Many had to be rescued by lifeguards who paddled out on boards. One man, Mohommed, was found lost in the impact zone as huge waves broke on top of him. He profusely thanked lifeguards for saving his life as he was dragged up the beach and put on oxygen. Others were lost under tons of water needing several attempts by lifeguards to get to them into shore.\n\nNearby, lifeguard Azza Graham was taking the opportunity to ride the massive waves on his surfboard. In a first class display he showed that big waves aren’t all doom and gloom for lifeguards.\n\nNever before has an episode of Bondi Rescue been able to capture the raw force of the ocean quite like this. And in doing so it has revealed the truly incredible skill and bravery of lifeguards, working in the service of others.",

At 5am the following morning lifeguards arrive to deal with the drunk, drug-affected, and disoriented, intent on going for a swim. There are 2 thousand people on the beach and not a towel in sight. The lack of swimming attire is of little concern to many who strip naked and welcome in the new year with a bit of skinny dipping.  \n\nMid-morning an emergency call comes in that a boat is taking water at the base of cliffs north of Bondi. Rushing there on the jetski Mouse and Ben arrive to find 23 year old Anthony in a hand built boat he bought on Ebay for two dollars and fifty-five cents. New Year's Eve was his maiden voyage - watching fire works in the harbour, but things went wrong when he decided to head for open water. Partygoers continue to swim as Deano does his best to persuade them to stay on dry land. Next a call comes in alerting lifeguards to a boy with a broken leg in the skate bowl. The steep sides of the bowl are more than ambulance officers are prepared to deal with, so lifeguards are left to move the clearly distressed 15 year old patient up to flat ground.    \n\nAs the end of the day comes to a close, a rescue of a different kind gets underway. A car is bogged behind the surf club, so Harries enlists the lifeguard buggies to pull it out of the mud, with the support of an unlikely team of helpers. Bondi ushers in the new year with the weird and wonderful, plus a few traps for unsuspecting visitors.",

The reality is not every Bondi wish comes true. Many beachgoers bite off more than they can chew, ending up sunburned, dumped by waves, and/or caught in rips.\n\nOne 16 year old is about to discover whether or not she has bitten off more than she can chew when she arrives at Bondi for a two week lifeguard exchange program. Temika Wright is an eager young trainee from Coffs Harbour hoping to learn how it's done on the world's busiest beach. Her first day is typical of a Saturday at Bondi when the tower is overrun by blue bottle victims. All are Chinese, most under 14, and only one of them can speak English. \n\nTemika's baptism of continues when a girl is found in a highly distressed state, having hit her head diving under a wave. The girl, visiting the beach with friends from the Blue Mountains, is only one year older than Temika. In a lot of pain, fearing she may have damaged her spine, the girl receives comforting assistance from the Coffs Harbour rookie.\n\nAnother accident in the surf involves a man with a major cut to his head from a surfboard. When lifeguard Brad moves his hand to inspect the cut, blood rapidly spurts out. Temika is taking on everything from first aids to dealing with ambulances, so the lifeguards up the ante by putting her through resuscitation drills and rescue techniques. Slight of frame but big of heart, she does her best to hold her own with the much larger boys, including Bondi trainee Maxy. Much more confident and experienced, Maxy offers to show Temika the ropes. But Maxy is soon to find the shoe on the other foot. Next week he'll be dispatched to Temika's home town to see how lifeguarding is done on the North Coast.",

The aerial surfing contest is the first  professional event staged at Bondi in 20 years. Lifeguard, and former world number 6 pro-surfer Rod Kerr, is ecstatic about reliving former glory when he surfs with old sparring partner Slater in the celebrity event. But foul play is afoot and Kerrbox finds his comeback sabotaged.\n\nLifeguards on Jet-skis are kept busy doing water safety for the event, as well as managing the massive crowds. On top of rescues, they’re soon dealing with a seizure, a dislocated knee, and a woman slashing herself with a blade. All lifeguard hands are on deck to make sure everyone goes home safely, and in Kerrbox’s case, still smiling.",
