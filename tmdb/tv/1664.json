It is a loose continuation of 2002's Spider-Man film directed by Sam Raimi. The show was made using computer generated imagery rendered in cel shading and was broadcast on MTV, and YTV. Eight months later after the series finale, episodes aired in reruns on ABC Family as part of the Jetix television programming block. The series featured a far more mature version of the character than typically seen on television for any animated comic book adaptation. Throughout the series, characters are clearly killed, rather than the usual ambiguous disappearance, and several characters are strongly implied to have had sex.","popularity":20.721,"poster_path":"/z4CRC612QrGrC1kLtDm8ykLeIrs.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8136,"logo_path":"/1JrepkIG6EsdklWZ9tZbE0uRHvj.png","name":"MTV","origin_country":""},{"id":7505,"logo_path":"/837VMM4wOkODc1idNxGT0KQJlej.png","name":"Marvel Entertainment","origin_country":"US"},{"id":11073,"logo_path":"/aCbASRcI1MI7DXjPbSW9Fcv9uGR.png","name":"Sony Pictures Television Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":23548,"logo_path":null,"name":"Adelaide Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":151541,"logo_path":"/sOz3vRS5B2KuysBcxTv7R1eelHX.png","name":"Mainframe Studios","origin_country":"CA"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2003-07-11","episode_count":13,"id":75494,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/j4OzVWrxUs17nPyyciloxfAEjsD.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":2.9}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.145,"vote_count":332,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"56ef3429c3a368225900b1d0","air_date":"2003-07-11","episodes":[{"air_date":"2003-07-11","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1177007,"name":"The Party","overview":"PETER PARKER struggles to balance his freshman year at Empire State University with his secret life as SPIDER-MAN.
