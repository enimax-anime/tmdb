Lightman finds that the woman has multiple personalities, and he believes that one of her personalities witnessed the murder. Lightman passes off helping Agent Reynolds vet a potential Supreme Court nominee, instead choosing to pursue the case of the multiple-personality woman. The case is passed on to Torres, whom the nominee does not treat with respect due to her age. Torres puts her preconceived judgments about the man aside when she analyzes the facts. Lightman unlocks the woman's original personality, who helps Lightman find the original murderer. Zoe informs Lightman that she is taking their daughter, Emily, and moving to Chicago to open a law firm.

The case hits home for Lightman, who learns that his daughter Emily was friends with the group of girls who attend these college fraternity parties. Through the course of their investigation, Lightman and Torres determine that Zoe's client was set-up by the girl, whose friends leaked the video of the hookup. Lightman figures that the man did not know the girl was underage, noting that his face showed that he knew he shouldn't find underage girls attractive. Meanwhile, Foster and Loker travel to a religious compound to determine whether its claim of IRS exemption is valid. They believe the head of the compound is holding the women against their will. Foster facilitates the escape of one woman and her children, and faces the wrath of both Loker and the government. At the end, the girl's father believes the system is protecting the football player, and decides that someone has to pay. He shoots the prosecutor that dropped the charges against the football player, with whose death the episode ends.","production_code":"2APW03","runtime":44,"season_number":2,"show_id":8358,"still_path":"/qwCi8IsuZvn9BWKJidcJnJwol4w.jpg","vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":7,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525790d0760ee36aaa6d0d7e","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78417,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Nick Santora","original_name":"Nick Santora","popularity":3.305,"profile_path":"/iipP9fTQhRuPJHFMhbpMCceBiiu.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Zoe Landau","credit_id":"525790cc760ee36aaa6d04de","order":507,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Beals","original_name":"Jennifer Beals","popularity":20.01,"profile_path":"/uJYKQC9GfRU3LHugCVDbAP1DrFH.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525790d0760ee36aaa6d0de4","order":515,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47297,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Marsters","original_name":"James Marsters","popularity":10.957,"profile_path":"/oJnBB3g2IINnsLSr8B79bJ9ykkx.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525790d0760ee36aaa6d0dfe","order":531,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":95638,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Pyper-Ferguson","original_name":"John Pyper-Ferguson","popularity":13.853,"profile_path":"/2IYFYfH67yG1UGedH49BYjigMe.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525790d0760ee36aaa6d0e18","order":548,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":161847,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Gretchen Egolf","original_name":"Gretchen Egolf","popularity":4.556,"profile_path":"/q5Uu9b3RavVcoJJcZoYvZb0CTaH.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525790d1760ee36aaa6d0e38","order":575,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3911,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Carroll Lynch","original_name":"John Carroll Lynch","popularity":11.212,"profile_path":"/cIx1HYFOHmfeAGRDBJwdFK9ZMIM.jpg"},{"character":"Susan","credit_id":"5514e904c3a368351e0017df","order":595,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":476866,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Allie Gonino","original_name":"Allie Gonino","popularity":4.478,"profile_path":"/wWeMydpnC9wplFDcZdLsArMdrlp.jpg"},{"character":"Zack","credit_id":"5b7a3f210e0a26473a039885","order":630,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":180182,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Colton Shires","original_name":"Colton Shires","popularity":0.926,"profile_path":"/bGryeTQKYgdZOR44FIw1GbCMcAj.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2009-10-12","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":395405,"name":"Control Factor","overview":"While on vacation in Mexico with Emily, Lightman becomes involved in the case of a missing American woman, who is a single mother on vacation with her daughter.
