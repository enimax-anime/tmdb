From termites to humpback whales, each creature's particular quirks and rituals are explored with joyful fascination as they navigate the dramatic - and sometimes dangerous - path of love, ensuring the survival of their species by relying on their animal instincts. With the production team having recorded over 4000 hours of fights, rebuffed advances and incredible displays aimed to impress, the veteran natural historian once again shows the animal kingdom as it has never quite been seen before.","popularity":4.401,"poster_path":"/5gWrmRXHD2duGcp9uvpwLaDSoJA.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67660,"logo_path":"/A34XRviX3Du3UvqjLkbWpmPz7kW.png","name":"Silverback Films","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":6790,"logo_path":"/A0TzRpnwLcUcNgrvDJ0BIajf56b.png","name":"Discovery Channel","origin_country":"US"},{"id":123270,"logo_path":"/4KxfGr13VXMr44og11hzpdwfQDQ.png","name":"bilibili","origin_country":"CN"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":15505,"logo_path":"/3MuBcEqLa5QRkZTpXBLzyk9zOmO.png","name":"NHK","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CN","name":"China"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"},{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2021-10-03","episode_count":5,"id":214184,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/sIRuwyShmjXgMFVTsEljcjurpAo.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Documentary","vote_average":7.9,"vote_count":7,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"615a566c81c7be0025e0d68b","air_date":"2021-10-03","episodes":[{"air_date":"2021-10-03","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":3258842,"name":"Grasslands: In Plain Sight","overview":"The strategies used by animals to find and defend their mates in the grasslands of Namibia, the Serengeti and Australia.
