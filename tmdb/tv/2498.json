Anthony Hopkins heads the cast as Pierre Bezuhov (a role for which he won the 1972 Best Actor BAFTA); Morag Hood is the impulsive and beautiful Natasha Rostova; Alan Dobie is the dour but heroic Andrei Bolkonsky; and David Swift is Napoleon, whose decision to invade Russia in 1812 has far-reaching consequences for Pierre and the Rostov and Bolkonsky families. The twenty-part serial was the vision of producer David Conroy whose principle aim was to transfer the rich characterisation and incident from Tolstoy's greatest novel to a television drama. Scripted by Jack Pulman and directed by John Davies, Conroy's War And Peace boasts superb acting, award-winning design (1972 Best Design BAFTA) and breathtaking battle sequences which were filmed in former Yugoslavia.","popularity":3.829,"poster_path":"/jt3Uv6xV8lRkoavO0gpVvPeL1Py.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":7939,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1972-09-29","episode_count":20,"id":7938,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":6,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52573aca760ee36aaa005ba9","air_date":"1972-09-29","episodes":[{"air_date":"1972-09-29","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1448245,"name":"Name Day","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":2498,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1972-10-05","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":189788,"name":"Sounds of War","overview":"At one of her soirees, Anna Scherer suggests Princess Maria Bolkonskya to Vasili Kuragin as a suitable match for his wayward son Anatole.
