The show was produced in 1962 by husband and wife team Gerry and Sylvia Anderson through their company APF, in association with ATV for ITC Entertainment. While developing his new show, Anderson thought a brand of motor oil—Castrol XL—had an interesting sound. A phonetic change created the name \"Fireball XL\", with the \"-5\" added as the title seemed a bit flat without the numeral.\n\nThe show featured the Andersons' Supermarionation, a form of puppetry first introduced in Four Feather Falls and Supercar and used again in their subsequent productions such as Stingray and Captain Scarlet. Thirty-nine black and white half-hour episodes of Fireball XL5 were made on 35mm film: all future Anderson series were produced in colour.\n\nSeveral Anderson series have been shown in syndication in the US, but Fireball XL5 is the only Anderson series to have run on a US network. NBC ran the series in its Saturday morning children's block from 1963 through to September 1965.\n\nA similar programme often confused with Fireball XL5 is Space Patrol, produced by Gerry Anderson's ex business partner and co-founder of AP Films, Arthur Provis due to a number of similarities and settings.","popularity":5.185,"poster_path":"/rBv16DzgKuzvx13KweU2nltONXU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":78348,"logo_path":null,"name":"AP Films (APF)","origin_country":""},{"id":34703,"logo_path":"/pZ4IVMy5M2742GwXqBIE8EkQiOA.png","name":"Associated Television (ATV)","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":1155,"logo_path":"/rKTzFu5woCo8k0u9ML7mWeLY541.png","name":"ITC Entertainment","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2002-01-01","episode_count":1,"id":12957,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1962-10-28","episode_count":39,"id":12956,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/hUR1BvkDFcnXxk6WwNieqOlJUV9.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":6.5}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.333,"vote_count":6,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52576659760ee36aaa37bce5","air_date":"1962-10-28","episodes":[{"air_date":"1962-10-28","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":302859,"name":"Planet 46","overview":"After intercepting a missile on course for earth, Steve Zodiac and the crew of the XL5 travel to Planet 46 and discover the Subterrains who launch another missile at the earth with Venus trapped inside.","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":1,"show_id":4378,"still_path":"/5VDdC2bu92RNWCkOSKSKiShokUa.jpg","vote_average":7,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257665a760ee36aaa37be2d","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213685,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Gerry Anderson","original_name":"Gerry Anderson","popularity":4.084,"profile_path":"/yw12JLxblMxnYCNH1u3KiABBn2X.jpg"},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257665a760ee36aaa37be53","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213685,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Gerry Anderson","original_name":"Gerry Anderson","popularity":4.084,"profile_path":"/yw12JLxblMxnYCNH1u3KiABBn2X.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257665a760ee36aaa37be3f","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":137380,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sylvia Anderson","original_name":"Sylvia Anderson","popularity":2.857,"profile_path":"/4bIiXMlHLxJc0NGYHAOhEeiyP7U.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"52576659760ee36aaa37bd79","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8398,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Bluthal","original_name":"John Bluthal","popularity":5.397,"profile_path":"/vdM8UyPL8Plaroa7rlOVX4SWbJ6.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1962-11-04","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":302855,"name":"The Doomed Planet","overview":"The Fireball XL5 narrowly misses a planet that bas broken out of it's orbit and realize the planet is on a collision course for the planet Membrono.
