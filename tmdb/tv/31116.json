It follows ghost-hunting brothers Brad and Barry Klinge, who founded Everyday Paranormal in October 2007.\n\nEveryday Paranormal is a paranormal investigation team whose stated mission is to \"visit the most haunted places in America, find evidence, and test new theories to probe the existence of the afterlife\" using a fringe-scientific approach.\n\nIn addition to Brad and Barry, the team included members Steve Harris, Hector Cisneros, and Katie Burr. Other members included Jason Worden, Ashlee Lehman, and Steve Hock. Ghost Lab remains the name of EP's mobile command center.\n\nOn October 14, 2009, Brad and Barry Klinge were interviewed on The Pat & Brian Show about the origins of Everyday Paranormal, current investigations, and equipment use.
