It was animated at the Slightly Offbeat Productions Studios in Penrose, Auckland, New Zealand. Coming on the heels of the direct-to-video sequel The Return of Jafar, the series picked up where that installment left off, with Aladdin now living in the palace, engaged to beautiful and spunky Princess Jasmine. \"Al\" and Jasmine went together into peril among sorcerers, monsters, thieves, and more. Monkey sidekick Abu, the animated Magic Carpet, and the fast-talking, shape-shifting Genie came along to help, as did sassy, complaining parrot Iago, formerly Jafar’s pet but now an antihero. Jafar, having previously been destroyed in the second movie, returns in only one episode which also serves as a crossover with Hercules: The Animated Series.","popularity":48.331,"poster_path":"/nlaiczW81kY46GBdfIcTrBIqr8I.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2,"logo_path":"/wdrCwmRnLFJhEoH8GSfymY85KHT.png","name":"Walt Disney Pictures","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1992-11-11","episode_count":7,"id":8921,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1994-09-05","episode_count":65,"id":8918,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/eDITSFHkTxxj06uHIOFjaMGpivo.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":4},{"air_date":"1994-09-17","episode_count":13,"id":8919,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/qA4rDnR43EwQsgVKBv58kQua7UE.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":4.1},{"air_date":"1995-09-16","episode_count":8,"id":8920,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/n6rwcF9k2G4zx978pO4sQHVttBk.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":3.8}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Swedish","iso_639_1":"sv","name":"svenska"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.923,"vote_count":298,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525743fb760ee36aaa0e1776","air_date":"1994-09-05","episodes":[{"air_date":"1994-09-05","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":214902,"name":"Air Feathered Friends","overview":"Abu often steals dates out of trees so Rasoul threatens to throw Abu in jail if he steals one more.
