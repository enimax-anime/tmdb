Driver. Car. Location. No limits. The result has been 9 Gymkhana films that have earned over 500million views on YouTube alone, won numerous ad awards for best branded content, and garnered millions of reposts, parodies, and tributes online. With GymkhanaTEN, the team wants to make their greatest film ever - with 5 cars, 5 different locations, and a brand new, radically different, custom built vehicle the world has never seen.

The home of American automotive, Detroit makes perfect sense as a Gymkhana location. With wide swathes of urban decay next door to a booming downtown, it paints a unique portrait of an American city. In the works for over 7 years, Ken & co have wanted to film a Gymkhana in Detroit since 2010, and finally get the opportunity. As the first shoot of GymkhanaTEN, the stakes here are incredibly high. This city will set the momentum for the rest of the year long project, so the team wants to get out the gate first.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":83545,"still_path":"/dlEwwqPIp0yCgrQMkNKKVXfnJhQ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-11-22","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1606723,"name":"In the Dirt","overview":"With a successful, if anticlimactic, ending to the first segment of GymkhanaTEN, Ken flies off to Loheac, France to continue his attempt to win a championship in the World Rallycross Championship, also known as WorldRX. A shoulder-to-shoulder, full contact circuit racing sport, rallycross takes the mixed surfaces and hot-hatch style cars of rally racing and puts it in an arena for fans to watch. One of the fastest growing motorsports, it has the eyes of manufacturers and fans alike.

You can't kickflip a car - but you might be able to grind it - with that idea translated over from skateboarding, the team takes the tires off a 1991 Ford Escort Cosworth RS to try something admittedly new to them. In an old tire factory in an industrial part of Los Angeles called South Gate, the Hoonigan team readies their wildest idea yet - an entire segment solely on rims.

Brian heads back to Hoonigan Media Machine, continuing to prep GymkhanaTEN, while Ken heads back to racing. After the lackluster results the team has seen in the first half of the season - Ken faces a difficult decision about his future in the World Rallycross Championship, and an unexpected announcement to the team. While those conversations weigh heavily on Ken, Brian heads halfway around the world to Sweden to ensure that the team is better prepared for the next segment.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":83545,"still_path":"/2sgKnFll2mlh0ce3NRxfAp5VVgd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-11-29","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":1606726,"name":"On Thin Ice","overview":"With the specter of Los Angeles hanging over them - Ken, Brian & co. head to Lule√•, Sweden to film their most challenging segment yet. A custom course cut out of the snow on a frozen ice lake, with only 3 hours of daylight and -30 degree Fahrenheit weather, the filming side must go off without a hitch in order for them to leave the Arctic with anything resembling a segment.

Brian and Ken, having completely ignored and moved past the arguments of Los Angeles, arrive in Texas with a mission - to ensure they throw dirt and smoke in the air of this sleepy Texas town. Shamrock, Texas is known for its world famous Conoco Tower - an icon depicted in all three of Pixar's Cars films.
