series began a summer run (ironically, enjoying its best ratings since the first season and tremendously better than it had done in the fall) with an episode about kidnappers grabbing the brother of a photographic model -- the brother is a veterinary student specializing in large-animal surgery, which he is to be forced to use to remove diamonds from the hide of an African rhinoceros recently imported to Los Angeles. Watch very fast for Natalie Wood bidding her then-husband Robert Wagner (Pete) goodbye from a bathtub at about the 10th minute.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":3,"show_id":9865,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Jenny Brown","credit_id":"5257f85619c29531db2d1cd6","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":130327,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"JoAnna Cameron","original_name":"JoAnna Cameron","popularity":2.8,"profile_path":"/fmwrNgd7Jrs26EvnOrRxeIarIBf.jpg"},{"character":"Jack Gaynor","credit_id":"5257f86319c29531db2d2e0f","order":612,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":33060,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ramon Bieri","original_name":"Ramon Bieri","popularity":4.323,"profile_path":"/rYzyiXLWajSyRFTXhh18eZZhXWr.jpg"},{"character":"Lt.
