The series revolved around the conflict between a supervillain named Killface and a superhero named Awesome X, alias billionaire Xander Crews, and much of the show's humor focuses on parodying superhero and action movie clich√©s. It debuted on October 16, 2006 and ended its first season on January 22, 2007; the second season premiered on August 26, 2007 and ended on March 23, 2008. A third season was in development, but in the absence of a renewal contract from Adult Swim, pre-production ceased. The production company itself, 70/30 Productions, subsequently went out of business in January 2009.\n\nA spin-off show, The Xtacles, premiered on November 9, 2008, but only two episodes were aired prior to the production company's closure.","popularity":9.306,"poster_path":"/57wmHjOuBpTvsJhgpdrg6xn2veV.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6760,"logo_path":"/h3syDHowNmk61FzlW2GPY0vJCFh.png","name":"Williams Street","origin_country":"US"},{"id":181672,"logo_path":"/8LI35nINNfJpaUN50sqqmBqXrbB.png","name":"Seventy-Thirty Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":4,"id":4220,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2006-10-16","episode_count":13,"id":4219,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/1nXPvnwKjTde765gC71AMBP5LOu.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2007-08-26","episode_count":12,"id":4218,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/dhBuPJav889XVbJTrOdtWiSNmdS.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":43,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52570c2919c295711400d8e9","air_date":"2006-10-16","episodes":[{"air_date":"2006-10-16","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":78782,"name":"Meet Killface","overview":"Killface, supervillain extraordinaire and loving father, has just begun his quest to destroy the world by smashing it into the sun using the Annihilatrix, a massive jet engine.
