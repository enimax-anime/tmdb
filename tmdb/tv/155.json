Dick's first instinct is to ask Mary to come, so he takes her to the planetarium before breaking the news to her that they are leaving, and asking her if she will join them. Meanwhile, since admitting his fear to Sally, Don has decided to quit the police force and open a muffin store, but Sally is disgusted by this career choice and decides to whip Don into shape - and turn him into a hardy police officer. At home, Harry and Tommy are attempting to organize a farewell party for the aliens, but have no money, so they decide to max out their credit cards and not worry about paying the bill, since they'll be halfway across the galaxy - they even hire Elvis Costello to sing Fly Me to the Moon.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"2001-05-22","episode_number":20,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"620","runtime":null,"season_number":6,"show_id":155,"still_path":null},"name":"3rd Rock from the Sun","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":6,"logo_path":"/cm111bsDVlYaC1foL0itvEI4yLG.png","name":"NBC","origin_country":"US"}],"number_of_episodes":139,"number_of_seasons":6,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"3rd Rock from the Sun","overview":"3rd Rock from the Sun is an American sitcom that aired from 1996 to 2001 on NBC.
