Bella leaves the country for Los Angeles and Dolly hides the diamonds, but she's also got a surprise in store for Harry.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":3361,"still_path":null,"vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"job":"Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"5f42747399d5c3003ab6cb84","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2399022,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Roger Wilson","original_name":"Roger Wilson","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","credit_id":"5f4360f999d5c3003ab96e5d","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1418094,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Dusty Miller","original_name":"Dusty Miller","popularity":2.187,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5f436091477215003562ebaf","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1227826,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Annett","original_name":"Paul Annett","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":"/pDOdixcMSHsNpOlWlei0UsTFkEG.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52574fdd760ee36aaa19ffde","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":126873,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lynda La Plante","original_name":"Lynda La Plante","popularity":4.563,"profile_path":"/dkmwa2wInc4b91JrkylhOa1KAEx.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Greg Withey","credit_id":"5f429e7981a7fc00340ba42b","order":554,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1516527,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Lovstrom","original_name":"Peter Lovstrom","popularity":1.415,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Micky Tesco","credit_id":"5f4ca8bf65e0a200355343af","order":555,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2637539,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew Kazamia","original_name":"Andrew Kazamia","popularity":1.22,"profile_path":"/x19OdjWwPL1WTJxwTfk14CyU0eV.jpg"},{"character":"Eddie Bates","credit_id":"5f4ca906eec4f30034d513b4","order":556,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2761311,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Mike Felix","original_name":"Mike Felix","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"D.I.
