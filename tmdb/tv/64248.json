Leon Dalville is a prince who has it all - good looks, love and wealth. One mysterious night, however, he loses everything. His young wife passes away in a fire and the prince’s face is permanently marred. To hide his disfigurement, he wears a silver mask that only partially covers his face, turning him into a mysterious and cruel man who is tormented by his past and hated and feared by all. Innocent and naive Bella Dubois comes to Leon’s castle to offer her services as a maid, to pay back the debts her father has with the prince. Leon’s cousin Helene, who has always been in love with him, challenges the prince: he must seduce and abandon Bella. But, despite Helene’s cruel and deceitful tricks, Leon falls in love with Bella.","popularity":9.206,"poster_path":"/6Wvca71Xt8s1Hk1pb10Lq7vTG5f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":21632,"logo_path":"/gEto1Q487D4JPriz2qVfkkvyqjy.png","name":"Mediaset España","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":1082,"logo_path":"/lEvojpyYkqD9W8mIEH5LB1cft2q.png","name":"Lux Vide","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2014-12-29","episode_count":2,"id":71610,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":7.4,"vote_count":118,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"562dcae2c3a3681b4b009353","air_date":"2014-12-29","episodes":[{"air_date":"2014-12-29","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1132552,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":100,"season_number":1,"show_id":64248,"still_path":"/vkN4TRuyoVcQFQ8UtzKJDDkKk8c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-12-30","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"finale","id":1132553,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":100,"season_number":1,"show_id":64248,"still_path":"/vkN4TRuyoVcQFQ8UtzKJDDkKk8c.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":71610,"poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
