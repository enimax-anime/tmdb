Sonohara then assimilates Niekawa's Saika, and as a result takes control of all of the Saikas in Ikebukuro. Sonohara apologizes to Celty for attacking her back in Episode 5. Mikado later visits Sonohara at the hospital, and after realizing she has met the \"unusual people,\" warns her to stay away from the non-normal. As a result of Niekawa's assimilation, Sonohara has gained her and all of the Saika's memories; she suspects that Izaya is up to something. Mikado is later shown contacting members of the Dollars, but it is unknown for what reason. The episode concludes, as Izaya's plot deepens further; he is revealed to be behind several events in the slasher arc. He has caused a split of the city's population into different \"factions;\" Saika/Sonohara's army, the Yellow Scarves, and the Dollars; and knows that they will fight amongst each other. Kida, not knowing Anri Sonohara's true nature, retakes his place as the leader of the Yellow Scarves. He suspects the Dollars to be responsible for Sonohara's injuries, and vows revenge.","production_code":"","runtime":24,"season_number":1,"show_id":42410,"still_path":"/AvgR4Vd3FEgtYt3rsNmN3zvxp1g.jpg","vote_average":7.7,"vote_count":3,"crew":[{"job":"Key Animation","department":"Visual Effects","credit_id":"6364014240d0fe008269558c","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1842746,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Koji Yabuno","original_name":"Koji Yabuno","popularity":3.226,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Key Animation","department":"Visual Effects","credit_id":"648fb095c2ff3d011cba3efb","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3797029,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Emiko Matsuno","original_name":"Emiko Matsuno","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Key Animation","department":"Visual Effects","credit_id":"648fb28fc3c89100ae51b9b3","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1845990,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Yasuhiro Saiki","original_name":"Yasuhiro Saiki","popularity":1.252,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Key Animation","department":"Visual Effects","credit_id":"648fb35b0f0da501390392b6","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3942059,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Masahiro Matsushita","original_name":"Masahiro Matsushita","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Animation Director","department":"Visual Effects","credit_id":"648fb43f0f0da500ffa8ca2c","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1982965,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Atsushi Aono","original_name":"Atsushi Aono","popularity":1.42,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Key Animation","department":"Visual Effects","credit_id":"648fb44d263462012d4af153","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1966511,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Tatsuo Yamada","original_name":"Tatsuo Yamada","popularity":1.008,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Key Animation","department":"Visual Effects","credit_id":"648fb474c3c891010ca5af42","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3718099,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Tomohito Taira","original_name":"Tomohito Taira","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-05-14","episode_number":18,"episode_type":"standard","id":879927,"name":"Out of Your Control","overview":"Confusion is starting to descend on the town of Ikebukuro.
