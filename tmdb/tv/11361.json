Amanda's aired on ABC from 10 February 1983 to 26 May 1983 on Thursday nights at 8:30.\n\nBea Arthur starred as the main character, Amanda Cartwright. Amanda was the owner of a seaside hotel called \"Amanda's by the Sea\" whose staff included her son Marty, his spoiled wife Arlene, Earl the chef and Aldo the bellhop.\n\nThis was Bea Arthur's first return to series television since Maude ended in 1978. Other stars appearing on Amanda's included Jerry Stiller, Leonard Stone and Todd Susman. The show was filmed in front of a live studio audience at ABC Studios, 4151 Prospect Avenue in Hollywood, California.\n\nAmanda's was cancelled in May 1983 after a four-month run of ten episodes, three more episodes remaining unaired by ABC. A&E network broadcast reruns of the show shortly thereafter.","popularity":2.664,"poster_path":"/3WNWvXSNzn07b7j8ScpincIW0m2.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1983-02-10","episode_count":13,"id":21852,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.667,"vote_count":3,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52580efc19c29531db43bcc7","air_date":"1983-02-10","episodes":[{"air_date":"1983-02-10","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":450211,"name":"All in a Day's Work","overview":"Amanda's hotel business will be finished unless she can smooth things over with a disgruntled hotel reviewer.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":11361,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52580efd19c29531db43bd84","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":21452,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Rich","original_name":"John Rich","popularity":1.375,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1983-02-17","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":450209,"name":"You Were Meant For Me","overview":"What's worse than the hotel being robbed?
