There are homes made out of shipping containers, horseboxes, and old buses. Others are building tiny huts or incredible treehouses in the middle of the woods.",

George also takes a trip to Bournemouth and meets Andrew and Emma Collett, who decided not to spend money on a honeymoon but bought a six foot by six foot beach hut to transform into a multi-function small space that can accommodate up to six guests for lunch. Hungry to find inspiration for his own small space caravan design, George visits Gemma Doyle who has lovingly restored some gypsy caravans back to their former glory. And on his own build, George tries to come up with an ingenious solution that will sleep his family of five in a space barely big enough for one double bed.",
