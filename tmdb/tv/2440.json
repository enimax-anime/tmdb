Off the set is a little different story. Bill is an egotistical jerk who verbally abuses his co-stars and crew members ... and even the children he was said to have adopted.\n\nHis off-screen attitude is put to the test when two orphans, who happen to be fans of \"\"That's Our Dad,\"\" and especially Bill Cassidy. The two track down Bill and ask if he'd consider adopting them ... especially because they have taken the closing segments to heart.\n\nWhen Bill refuses to speak to them, and later tells them to get lost, the children enlist Jonathan and Mark's help in talking with Bill and setting his attitude straight.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":3,"show_id":2440,"still_path":"/t0DFYamXFznGNMo2I7loZmyTQBn.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525738a2760ee3668d00e4ff","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":83453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Victor French","original_name":"Victor French","popularity":13.601,"profile_path":"/mtvywlfKrr0DgY72CONUmWcCYwV.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"525738ba760ee3668d010e30","order":576,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":154307,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"R.J.
