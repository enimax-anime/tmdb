The competition now fires up with one extraordinary challenge: making a show stopping dish for judges Michel and Gregg, joined by Michel's formidable sous chef, Monica Galetti. \n\nTo win over this trio of palates, they will have to cook out of their skin. With only one hour and 45 minutes to deliver, they have to make a simply sublime dish bursting with skill, flair, flavour, and of course it has to be immaculately presented. The stakes are high for the chefs who must fight for one of only six places - to stay in the competition they will have to fire on every cylinder. At the end of it, Michel and Gregg will decide which two chefs are leaving the competition. \n\nOnly the six best chefs will go on to battle for the title of Professional Masterchef.",

After five weeks of competing the most talented contestants have made it through to the finals week and are one step closer to winning the Professional MasterChef title. But there is one more task standing between them and the amazing culinary adventures ahead. The chefs have to invent two courses from a range of ingredients. But to really push their creativity and inventiveness, they are given no fish, no meat and no poultry. Who is versatile enough to cook a daring, flavoursome and delicious meal for the judges without some of the most common ingredients at their disposal? And who will fall by the wayside at this crucial stage?",
