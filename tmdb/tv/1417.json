wake of Kurt’s departure, Blaine tries to distract from his loneliness by entering the race for Senior Class President. The move puts him in direct conflict with Brittany who looks to repeat for a second term. After struggling to come up with fresh ideas for New Directions, Will begins to fear that he’s losing his enthusiasm for show choir. When an opportunity to reignite his passion and make a lasting positive impact on his students presents itself, the procrastinating Will gets prodding from two vastly different sources. After landing an internship with fashion icon Isabelle Klempt, Kurt comes up with an out-of-the-box idea to revitalize the fashionista’s sagging brand.
