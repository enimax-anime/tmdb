Meanwhile, Elsie Tanner is on at her son, Dennis, to get some work but he reminds her that it's not easy for someone who's just got out of prison. Later, there's a misunderstanding when Elsie accuses Dennis of taking money from her purse when in fact it was her daughter Linda. Also, Linda tells Elsie that she's leaving her husband. Elsie says she'll believe it when she sees it!   At number 3, there's unrest at the Barlow's. Young Kenneth Barlow has an argument with his father, Frank, when he announces that he's met a girl and he's taking her to the Imperial Hotel. Frank argues that Ken has all but forgotten his working class roots.",

Albert accidentally grows parsley instead of onions at his allotment and gives them out to everyone to get rid of them. Christine makes it clear to Elsie that she doesn't like her taking personal calls at work. She overhears Elsie complaining about her on the phone to Len. As he admires his new shop front, Frank is confident that the opening will draw a crowd. The residents are worried for him as the shop is in a bad location. Florrie sorts out the refreshments for the opening. Len gets a letter from Stanley and is upset that Stanley doesn't seem bothered about seeing him. Elsie takes the day off work to go to the opening, without clearing it with Christine.",

David can't understand why Ken is still staying in the Street and believes he can do better than Bessie Street School. Frank tells David he now understands why he stayed away when Ida died. Valerie suggests that Ken apply to teach at a grammar school as he'll earn more money. Ken dismisses the idea as he's happy where he is. David buys everyone drinks at the Rovers.

Len reveals that the PPOP members are all doing business with Laurie and that Alderman Langton has sold Laurie his share of the factory. Val doesn't know what to do to help Ken. She blames him and he hates her for not being completely interested in him. He tells her he doesn't need a wife, he needs someone who understands him. They realise they shouldn't have married. Len thinks of taking on an apprentice with all the work at the shop and the club. Dennis takes the blame for a smashed crate so that he will be sacked. After drowning his sorrows, Ken returns home to find Val has left. Val arrives at Dave's flat with her suitcase.",

The womenfolk gather in the Rovers, not wanting to be on their own whilst the convict is on the loose. Val tries to alert Ena by banging on the water pipes. She is terrified when Peter wakes up and Riley realises she has children. Ken phones Val but Riley refuses to let her answer it, threatening to hurt Peter and Susan. Ena hears the phone ringing and begins to worry. Riley takes a fancy to Val and starts caressing her. Ena raises the alarm. Annie takes charge and Jack phones the police. Riley demands money and clothes from Val. He then tells her he wants something from her. The police move the residents into houses so no one is alone. Val promises that she won't raise the alarm if Riley leaves her alone but Riley sees the police outside. Ken arrives at the Rovers, not knowing anything of what is happening.",

Deirdre is annoyed that Alf has won. Tom and Hilda are reconciled, deciding that it's stupid to argue. Betty is talked into joining the tea dance. Ivy tries to explain to Gail that she didn't invite Liz Turnbull round but Gail doesn't believe her. She tells him that she's not bringing Nicky round to No.5 as long as there's the chance of Liz popping round. Ivy lays into her, accusing her of being a bad mother in the first place for having an affair. Phyllis makes the most of the tea dances to capture new men. Betty meets George Daly at the dance and agrees to be his partner. Alf expects Deirdre to return to work now Ken is out of the elections. She tells him that he's underhand and will never work for him again. Betty and George enjoy dancing together.",
