The country is in the process of being paved, and from coast to coast cities and towns are changing to suit the automobile. The middle class is growing thanks to the booming manufacturing sector, made possible by the advent of mass production–and it’s all fueling an American obsession with cars and the newfound freedom of the road. The entire industry is now dominated by just three companies–Ford, General Motors, and Chrysler–known simply as The Big Three. But as The Big Three become larger and more powerful, the battle to be number one heats up.","production_code":"","runtime":85,"season_number":1,"show_id":73295,"still_path":"/YPnkxSrB3w4WWQidbZ6MRdTFzH.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":null,"episode_number":3,"episode_type":"finale","id":1349902,"name":"Part 3","overview":"In the aftermath of WWII, America is moving to the suburbs, fueling a huge demand for new cars. But The Big Three spent the war building weapons and vehicles for the Allies, and haven't made a new car in years. It's a race to give new American consumers what they want, and the result is the Golden Age of the American automobile. The youth of the 50's and 60's want speed and fun, and The Big Three battle each other to give it to them, creating the all-American muscle car. But, as they do, external influences threaten to bring the industry to its knees.","production_code":"","runtime":85,"season_number":1,"show_id":73295,"still_path":"/y08RGsJU6Os7eaO42I1D7QLnl54.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":91398,"poster_path":"/w7lD8iUYnJA4A7Rl1WJq6YNpG5W.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
