Now, the Marcel family has come forward with a journal found among Marcel's possessions. The journal may contain coded-clues to the truth behind Roswell. Former CIA operative Ben Smith embarks on a new investigation that includes a cryptographic analysis of the journal, a high tech geological study of the crash site, and interviews with witnesses who have never spoken publicly. What really crashed in Roswell? The US government claimed it was a weather balloon and then changed its story. Others spoke of alien bodies, and extreme government intimidation.",

Smith also digs deeper into the mystery of the journal as he studies writing samples to determine if the journal might have been written by one of Marcel's fellow officers who later claimed he was ordered to oversee the military's coverup. Back in Marcel's hometown, Smith meets with a man who swears Marcel confided in him about alien bodies-- something Marcel had never mentioned to the press or family. As the results come back from soil, metal and forensic handwriting analysis, Smith shares his findings with the Marcel grandchildren.",

No ship in history has searched the extreme depths of the Bermuda Triangle, thought to have claimed over 1,000 ships and planes, until now. The late Paul Allen's ship, R/V Petrel, the most advanced search vessel of its kind, will deploy a wide array of cutting edge technology including deep-diving submersibles to investigate three miles down, in an effort, to find the lost squadron and solve the mystery that began the legend of the Bermuda Triangle.",
