The only catch is that both Erica and Barry are headed to the same school! That leaves the youngest and resident geek Adam as the only Goldberg child left in the house. Adam’s year will be legendary too as he navigates life as a nerdy upperclassmen, while still facing nefarious bullies, social anxieties and maybe even the return of a “first” love he thought moved away.
