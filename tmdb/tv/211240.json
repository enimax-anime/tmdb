A previously unknown ice worm destabilizes continental slopes in the oceans and triggers tsunamis. A deadly pathogen is spreading from the coasts in drinking water. More and more people in the world are in mortal danger. On the feverish search for the causes of the mysterious phenomena, a small group of international scientists comes together and the previously unthinkable finally becomes a certainty. A previously unknown species exists in the sea and this swarm intelligence is attacking mankind. But hardly anyone believes the researchers. And so the group dares to go on a life-threatening mission on their own. The traces lead them with their research ship into the eternal ice of the Arctic Ocean. An ecological thriller based on the international bestselling novel by Frank Schätzing. The most expensive German TV production of all time.","popularity":90.17,"poster_path":"/dAr6GCccudtiZHpzhquMg3TalvW.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":191376,"logo_path":"/mFLnfvMBFqSov1jJ8xGKhYCvEor.png","name":"Intaglio Films","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":189052,"logo_path":null,"name":"ndF International Production","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":4606,"logo_path":"/otZHbf1HmzLRQsZFSqJXkf8EHz7.png","name":"ZDF","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":7131,"logo_path":"/eLvjHPYZ12GR58lrDgg6MXZp2a3.png","name":"France Télévisions","origin_country":"FR"},{"id":1583,"logo_path":"/6EFUenZrAK7IBbirooJ4ZLzJpJ5.png","name":"RAI","origin_country":"IT"},{"id":3391,"logo_path":"/t0QBs2fI3mE3HxgoH1n39bYuzNu.png","name":"ORF","origin_country":"AT"},{"id":42145,"logo_path":"/fX8uY3tXWh814PLVqKM0IJEoDPW.png","name":"SRF","origin_country":"CH"},{"id":108472,"logo_path":"/tFVfsfRFv8sGpX6SvoDvw2nGoeO.png","name":"Viaplay Group","origin_country":"SE"},{"id":140361,"logo_path":"/fibZ29NMQS46v7vXZ1Y3uXL7Q39.png","name":"Hulu Japan","origin_country":"JP"},{"id":193497,"logo_path":"/r3y0P6aqx0sCeukzB1miUqfYaFO.png","name":"Bravado Fiction","origin_country":"BE"},{"id":193498,"logo_path":null,"name":"Beside Productions","origin_country":"BE"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"AT","name":"Austria"},{"iso_3166_1":"BE","name":"Belgium"},{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"},{"iso_3166_1":"DE","name":"Germany"},{"iso_3166_1":"IT","name":"Italy"},{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"},{"iso_3166_1":"SE","name":"Sweden"},{"iso_3166_1":"CH","name":"Switzerland"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2023-03-09","episode_count":5,"id":329105,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/7i4xKROoPZ2OOhU9yDv8N0tatSe.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2023-03-06","episode_count":8,"id":310583,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/jZMp6e2b3BQLl0NlEi0ssJReQ5C.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":5.7}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Italian","iso_639_1":"it","name":"Italiano"},{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"},{"english_name":"Dutch","iso_639_1":"nl","name":"Nederlands"},{"english_name":"French","iso_639_1":"fr","name":"Français"},{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":6.829,"vote_count":70,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"6335dd58a06645007e06f4d1","air_date":"2023-03-06","episodes":[{"air_date":"2023-03-06","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":3979948,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"Charlie Wagner, a young marine biologist, is assigned to a remote outpost in the Shetland Islands. During a survey, Charlie discovers large amounts of methane ice on the water surface, which is usually only found at great depths on the sea floor. And other strange incidents are happening in different regions of the world. While a fisherman in Peru dies unnoticed by a school of fish, in Canada, off Vancouver Island, the humpback and gray whales are a long time coming. When an orca is found dead on the beach after allegedly attacking a fishing boat, young whale researcher Leon Anawak is concerned. Eventually, the whales return in large numbers.
