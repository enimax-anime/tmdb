Meanwhile, Hardcastle, realizing that Mark's parole is up, decides to buy a car repair business, as a surprise gift for his friend. Upon hearing about Mark's job offer, Hardcastle, not wanting to stand in his friend's way, lies and tells his friend that he bought the company for himself. For his first assignment at law firm Malcolm, Hughes and Dewitt, Mark is asked to reclaim the possessions of Elsey, a resident of the Sunset Acres Retirement Home. Arriving at the home, Mark makes the acquaintance of Mimi LeGrand, a retired actress. Immediately liking Mimi, Mark is more than willing to comply when the former actress asks him to open a bank account for her. To Mark's surprise, he discovers that someone has already opened an account in Mimi's name. Concerned, Mark decides to go to Hardcastle for help. Before the two men are able to really learn anything in the case, they end up in jail as a result of a mistake made by Leroy, Hardcastle's assistant at the car company. While awaiting their release, Hardcastle decides to tell his friend the truth about why he bought the company. In response, Mark reveals that he has been going to law school in an attempt to follow in his friend's footsteps. Once released, Hardcastle and McCormick discover evidence that Malcolm and resident home manager Leonard Porter have been killing the residents and stealing their money. (They were able to move the money by secretly creating bank accounts in the seniors' names.) Armed with sufficient evidence, the crime fighting duo stop Malcolm and Porter. Despite the fall of his professor, Mark vows to continue attending law school. After selling the car business, Hardcastle makes a generous bet with Mark: If the ex-race car driver can beat him in a game of basketball, the judge will pay the law school bill. Due in the most part to Hardcastle's generosity, Mark wins the game.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"1986-05-05","episode_number":22,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":3,"show_id":1271,"still_path":null},"name":"Hardcastle and McCormick","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":2,"logo_path":"/2uy2ZWcplrSObIyt4x0Y9rkG6qO.png","name":"ABC","origin_country":"US"}],"number_of_episodes":67,"number_of_seasons":3,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Hardcastle and McCormick","overview":"Hardcastle and McCormick is an American action/drama television series from Stephen J.

Thanks to Mark, Hardcastle discovers that Denny was romantically involved with a woman named Pamela Bayer. The judge's earlier suspicions gain some validity when Hardcastle and McCormick see a group of men try to kidnap Pamela. After rescuing Pamela, Hardcastle and McCormick learn that the prospective kidnappers work for reputed mobster Sonny Austin, her ex-boyfriend. Realizing that Sonny, in an irrational attempt to win back his ex-girlfriend, has been assaulting all Pamela's dates, Hardcastle and McCormick try to find out who has been providing the mobster with her dating schedule. It turns out that Pamela has been primarily dating comedians employed at Boots Dikeman's club. Figuring that Leo Dikeman, Boots' main competitor, is probably encouraging Sonny, Hardcastle and McCormick decide to pay him a visit. Before they arrive, Sonny, realizing that he has been used, kills Leo. Facing a dead end in the case, the judge asks Mark to pose as one of Pamela's comedian boyfriends.

Confronting the performers about why they are hiding out, Cluracan, the groups leader, explains that they are fleeing from communist agents that want to return them to their home country as well as Marvin, a circus promoter that had promised their services to Circus Maximus. As for the mysterious gold, Cluracan reveals that it is his family's money. The next day, communist agent Ivan and his men come to the estate disguised as employees of Ladies Garden Monthly, the magazine sponsoring the contest Hardcastle has entered. At the same time, Marvin and his men sneak onto the estate. With the circus performer's help, Hardcastle and McCormick manage to stop the agents as well as Marvin and his men. Later, Mark's continued suspicion that Cluracan's group are secretly Leprechauns seems to be confirmed when a rainbow leads to a mysteriously repaired Coyote.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":3,"show_id":1271,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52541a7919c295794039ebc1","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":22111,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Hugh Kelly","original_name":"Daniel Hugh Kelly","popularity":6.47,"profile_path":"/bueEXd57jY2PWZUC1nRRBmIE2Ou.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1986-03-31","episode_number":21,"episode_type":"standard","id":59460,"name":"The Day the Music Died","overview":"While driving through Arizona on his way home from Las Vegas, Mark is surprised to hear the voice of Nick Damion, a rock deejay he idolized in his youth, on local radio station KKSB.

Meanwhile, Hardcastle, realizing that Mark's parole is up, decides to buy a car repair business, as a surprise gift for his friend. Upon hearing about Mark's job offer, Hardcastle, not wanting to stand in his friend's way, lies and tells his friend that he bought the company for himself. For his first assignment at law firm Malcolm, Hughes and Dewitt, Mark is asked to reclaim the possessions of Elsey, a resident of the Sunset Acres Retirement Home. Arriving at the home, Mark makes the acquaintance of Mimi LeGrand, a retired actress. Immediately liking Mimi, Mark is more than willing to comply when the former actress asks him to open a bank account for her. To Mark's surprise, he discovers that someone has already opened an account in Mimi's name. Concerned, Mark decides to go to Hardcastle for help. Before the two men are able to really learn anything in the case, they end up in jail as a result of a mistake made by Leroy, Hardcastle's assistant at the car company. While awaiting their release, Hardcastle decides to tell his friend the truth about why he bought the company. In response, Mark reveals that he has been going to law school in an attempt to follow in his friend's footsteps. Once released, Hardcastle and McCormick discover evidence that Malcolm and resident home manager Leonard Porter have been killing the residents and stealing their money.

Despite the fall of his professor, Mark vows to continue attending law school. After selling the car business, Hardcastle makes a generous bet with Mark: If the ex-race car driver can beat him in a game of basketball, the judge will pay the law school bill. Due in the most part to Hardcastle's generosity, Mark wins the game.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":3,"show_id":1271,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52541a7419c295794039e820","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1221343,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Carol Mendelsohn","original_name":"Carol Mendelsohn","popularity":2.473,"profile_path":"/8PlgEHno8Mvg4wqireq7ZQY6Y3a.jpg"},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52541a7319c295794039e5cd","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1222811,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Les Sheldon","original_name":"Les Sheldon","popularity":3.375,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"63a295c9bcf8c9007d5ec572","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":3839599,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marianne Clarkson","original_name":"Marianne Clarkson","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 3","overview":"","id":3359,"poster_path":"/2E0EGAlYo1wCTXyKjA2bZ2ipmdQ.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0}}}
