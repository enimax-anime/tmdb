This agency takes on claims of miscarriages of justice, assessing whether there are grounds to reopen old cases.\n\nRose is brilliant but strong-willed and sometimes reckless. She likes to follow her instincts and play hunches and often comes into conflict with authority. Maloney, although Rose's superior, usually allows himself to be led by his more passionate colleague. Maloney is a by-the-book man and a little grey. He finds working with Rose dangerous but addictively exciting.\n\nA pilot was first broadcast on ITV on 29 September 2002. A series of three stories followed in July 2005.\n\nThroughout all the series many actors and actresses starred in the programme including Tara Fitzgerald, Danny Dyer, Tiana Benjamin, Andrew-Lee Potts and Neil Dudgeon to name but a few.","popularity":6.035,"poster_path":"/ngjIfAZKvk2QdFy3SzjK7CGBFUL.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2002-09-29","episode_count":2,"id":25657,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2004-07-05","episode_count":6,"id":25658,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2005-09-12","episode_count":3,"id":25659,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52582fbf760ee36aaa8d28a6","air_date":"2002-09-29","episodes":[{"air_date":"2002-09-29","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":517188,"name":"Rose And Maloney (1)","overview":"Rose is sent to work with administrative manager Maloney, after being disgraced, but she is soon dragging him into a case of injustice - a mother's plea that her son is not guilty of the rape and murder of his daughter.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":14287,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2002-09-30","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"finale","id":517189,"name":"Rose And Maloney (2)","overview":"Rose is sent to work with administrative manager Maloney, after being disgraced, but she is soon dragging him into a case of injustice - a mother's plea that her son is not guilty of the rape and murder of his daughter.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":14287,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":25657,"poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},"2":{"_id":"52582fbf760ee36aaa8d28b1","air_date":"2004-07-05","episodes":[{"air_date":"2004-07-05","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":517190,"name":"The Case of Daniel Berrington (1)","overview":"Rose receives an appeal from Daniel Berrington, who was found guilty of murdering retired army officer Arthur Towns when he was ten years old.
