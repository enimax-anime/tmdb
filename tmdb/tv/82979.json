Once he starts thinking about them, he becomes too absorbed to care about anything else! People think he is quite odd and eccentric! But gradually his attitude, free from restrictions of rigid common sense and social norms, changes the way of thinking of those around him. They can recall a time when they, too, were engrossed in something they loved.","popularity":4.887,"poster_path":"/2nMSk1281qw8mXUOmG5LfQ01zEw.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3341,"logo_path":"/dTG5dXE1kU2mpmL9BNnraffckLU.png","name":"Fuji Television Network","origin_country":"JP"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"JP","name":"Japan"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2018-10-09","episode_count":10,"id":110560,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/vJqxCPZK8HNvXpxo0luta6rsL4e.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":3}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Japanese","iso_639_1":"ja","name":"日本語"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":4,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5bbc62ba0e0a26660601368a","air_date":"2018-10-09","episodes":[{"air_date":"2018-10-09","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1590705,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":55,"season_number":1,"show_id":82979,"still_path":null,"vote_average":3,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-10-16","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1590714,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":55,"season_number":1,"show_id":82979,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-10-23","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1590715,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":55,"season_number":1,"show_id":82979,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-10-30","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":1590717,"name":"Episode 4","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":55,"season_number":1,"show_id":82979,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-11-06","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":1590719,"name":"Episode 5","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":55,"season_number":1,"show_id":82979,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-11-13","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":1620780,"name":"Episode 6","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":55,"season_number":1,"show_id":82979,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-11-20","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":1620781,"name":"Episode 7","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":55,"season_number":1,"show_id":82979,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-11-27","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"standard","id":1620782,"name":"Episode 8","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":55,"season_number":1,"show_id":82979,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-12-04","episode_number":9,"episode_type":"standard","id":1709431,"name":"Episode 9","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":55,"season_number":1,"show_id":82979,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2018-12-11","episode_number":10,"episode_type":"finale","id":1709432,"name":"Episode 10","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":55,"season_number":1,"show_id":82979,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":110560,"poster_path":"/vJqxCPZK8HNvXpxo0luta6rsL4e.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":3}}}
