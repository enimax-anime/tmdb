Lyons visits Action Vehicle Engineering (where these cars are maintained) and talks to Hot Wheels’ Sr. Design Manager for Die-Cast Vehicles, Bryan Benedict. Bryan lends insight into the monumental influence that the Twin Mill has had within Hot Wheels, his personal career and the car world at large. After Nicole and Bryan highlight all the full-size Twin Mill attributes, Lyons takes the temperamental, dual engine behemoth on a test drive through the desert where things get smoky.",

Hot Wheels decided to make that dream reality in 2012 when they sent two cars through a six-story loop and had another perform a record-breaking corkscrew jump. On this episode, Lyons meets with Alton Takeyasu, the man in charge of the stunt cars and Tanner Foust, one of the daring men to get behind the wheel. Lyons learns what it takes to make it through these crazy stunts and what modifications had to go into the cars. Afterwards, Lyons and Foust hop in the stunt cars – the Loop Coupe and the Corkscrew Buggy – for a drive around Willow Springs Raceway, learning that these stripped-down powerhouses were not built for comfort.",

Brendon Vetusky, a Hot Wheels designer, did the opposite by making a full-sized 1967 Firebird first then turned it into a Hot Wheels diecast vehicle. In this episode, Lyons meets Brendon in California where he built the Firebird in his driveway. Brendan takes viewers through all the modifications he made to the Pontiac as he built it into a stripped down, racecourse ready monster. Also, he talks about how he became a designer at Hot Wheels, his history with die-cast cars, and the overlap between making full sized cars and working for Mattel. Because the car was built for the track, Lyons hops in the passenger seat as Brendon crushes a rallycross course at Famoso Raceway.",
