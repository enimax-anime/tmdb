He was known as the \"Happy Face Killer\" because he drew \"smiley faces\" on his numerous letters to the media and authorities. Many of his victims were sex workers and transients who had no personal connection to him. Strangulation was Jesperson's preferred method of murdering, the same method he often used to kill animals as a child. He was eventually arrested and convicted. He is serving multiple life sentences in prison, with no possibility of parole.",

Told through interview footage with Kemper himself, as well as people who were there, this episode takes viewers inside the mind of a serial killer, from a childhood wrought with abuse through an early life of violence. Kemper outlines his motives for the killing spree and describes the terrifying methods he used to slaughter young women, operating right under everyone’s noses. As Kemper explains in great detail, he spared no one from his madness, not even his own flesh and blood. With his willingness to tell his story so openly, Kemper would go on, years later, to assist the FBI in profiling serial killers, offering insight into how, and why, killers like himself commit such horrific acts.",

For decades, Durst has been living under a cloud of suspicion. His first wife went missing in 1982, but the case went cold when there were no leads — and no body. Then, 18 years later, just as the investigation into her disappearance was re-opened, Durst’s best friend and confidante, Susan Berman, was shot dead inside her home. At the same time, Durst was hiding in Galveston, Texas disguised as a deaf mute woman. But when his neighbor’s dismembered body turns up in Galveston Bay, Durst’s story begins to unravel. He is quickly arrested, but he’s not in custody for long. After posting bail, he goes on the run. Where is Robert Durst?",

He would tell a jury he killed Black accidentally in self-defense, and he’d be acquitted of murder. But his story doesn’t end there. Durst decides to give a revealing look into his life in the six-part series “the Jinx” where in the final episode he is overheard in the bathroom muttering to himself, “killed them all, of course.” Before the episode airs, Durst is arrested for the murder of his best friend, Susan Berman. Now as he stands trial in Los Angeles, will his own words come back to haunt him?",

                    "overview": "Keith Hunter Jesperson (born April 6, 1955) is a Canadian-American serial killer who murdered at least eight women in the United States during the early 1990s. He was known as the \"Happy Face Killer\" because he drew \"smiley faces\" on his numerous letters to the media and authorities. Many of his victims were sex workers and transients who had no personal connection to him. Strangulation was Jesperson's preferred method of murdering, the same method he often used to kill animals as a child. He was eventually arrested and convicted. He is serving multiple life sentences in prison, with no possibility of parole.",
