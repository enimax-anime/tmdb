    "overview": "High school student Do-hoe lives with his father who runs a Taekwondo gym in a rural area. He despises the violent and brutal atmosphere of his home. One day, his cheerful and bright peer Ju-young, who dreams of going to college with a Taekwondo major, comes from Seoul. With Ju-young's arrival, small and large joys begin to fill Do-hoe's previously dark life. However, the oppressive culture symbolized by his father ultimately twists their relationship, and after an unexpected incident forces them apart, they reunite ten years later. It warmly portrays the transformation of feelings that start with innocent excitement into a deep love that embraces and heals each other's wounds.",
