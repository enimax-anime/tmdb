The first round masters the basics and challenges the competitors to re-create one of Julia's signature dishes, with some guidance from Julia herself, as seen on a giant television screen in the middle of the action. Round 2 is an ode to Julia, where competitors must take inspiration from Julia to create a unique dish reflecting their own culinary point of view. Dishes from the second round are served family-style, with competitors and judges sampling each dish and sharing stories about their food journeys and personal connection to Julia. Antonia Lofaso and a rotating panel of guest judges will decide which of the competitors wins the life-changing grand prize that literally follows in Julia's footsteps: an all-expense paid three-month cooking course at Le Cordon Bleu.",
