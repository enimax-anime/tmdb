        "overview": "Explores the unusual station at Old Street. It serves both the Northern line and mainline trains, and they discover how the platforms and tunnels differ across the two different services. The station has undergone massive changes since it first opened in 1901, and there’s still plenty of evidence of its early years, if you know where to look. Tim goes through a tiny doorway to discover a hidden passage with an original fully-tiled vaulted ceiling. Siddy discovers a staircase last used in the 1920s, which still has the original sign showing the Northern Line tube stops.\n\nSiddy visits Hampstead, the deepest station below ground on the entire Underground network. Unsurprisingly, it also has the deepest lift shaft, and she gets to ride on top of the lift to see the record-breaking 55-metre shaft up close.\n\nAt our Museum depot, Tim meets the first ever female driver on the Victoria line. She talks about working on the tube in the 1970s.",

Tim meets the team checking all the carriages, and sees the incredible precision needed to finely shave the metal wheels to keep them running smoothly on the tracks. Siddy checks the vintage control panel on the tower and finds it is still in working order.\n\nThey ride on the private service that links the depot with Seven Sisters station alighting at its mysterious third platform.\n\nAt Finsbury Park station on the Victoria and Piccadilly lines, Siddy does a night-time track walk to access the now-disused tunnel which was part of an early experiment to run large electric mainline trains on the tube.\n\nAt our Museum Tim hears about the importance of design across the tube network, and looks at the bespoke designs for seating fabric across different underground lines.",

It was originally the terminus station for the City and South London Railway – the first ever deep level electric tube railway in the world, and the birth of the tube as we know it. Tim finds evidence of a deep level shelter used by Londoners during the Second World War. On the platforms, he reveals something rather more contemporary – the tiles depicting a swan in homage to a local pub. As Siddy descends deep into the station, she finds metallic tiles on the walls and cast iron segments in a disused lift shaft, each crucial relics of their era.\n\nSiddy visits the main depot for the DLR. She hears how they’re developing new technology to alert them to any passengers on the tracks. And she gets a preview of their new fleet of trains currently on test runs along the network.\n\nAt the Museum depot, Tim explores the items in their collection charting the history of the DLR, including models of the original 1986 trains.",

It was built as two separate stations, with the earliest, grander section opening in the 1860s. Tim finds an original footbridge still overlooking the modern platforms, as well as a hidden space where you can still see the brickwork of the early tunnels. Siddy explores the later station – a Leslie Green design built in the early 1900s with original tiles and remains of the lifts still in evidence. Tim and Siddy also explore the now-disused platform that’s been turned into an art gallery.\n\nSiddy leaves London to visit Goole in Yorkshire where 70 new Piccadilly line trains are being assembled. She gets a tour of the factory and is allowed on board a new open-plan carriage, being fitted with air conditioning.",

The station has undergone massive changes since it first opened in 1901, and there’s still plenty of evidence of its early years, if you know where to look. Tim goes through a tiny doorway to discover a hidden passage with an original fully-tiled vaulted ceiling. Siddy discovers a staircase last used in the 1920s, which still has the original sign showing the Northern Line tube stops.\n\nSiddy visits Hampstead, the deepest station below ground on the entire Underground network. Unsurprisingly, it also has the deepest lift shaft, and she gets to ride on top of the lift to see the record-breaking 55-metre shaft up close.\n\nAt our Museum depot, Tim meets the first ever female driver on the Victoria line. She talks about working on the tube in the 1970s.",
