RK Garage will show Freiburger and Dulcich wrenching on Roadkill project cars and other things that meet the Roadkill vibe. They'll show you how to do the wrong things the right way. In this episode, the guys attempt a three-day overhaul of the 351 Cleveland engine from the '67 Mercury Cougar that belonged to Freiburger when the show began, but that transferred to Dulcich before the shoot was over. The \"rebuild\" is not exactly kosher, but it's dirt cheap and generates good tire smoke!",

In this episode of Roadkill Garage, the Crop Duster is back! It has a fresh, 500-horsepower 383 engine now, and is fresh off the road from Hot Rod magazine’s Drag Weekend event where—it will come as no surprise—the car had some trouble. That included a wiring fire and a fuel-delivery problem that held the car back to a 12.06-second e.t.—not much better than the old 12.34 considering the newer, much more powerful engine. In this Roadkill Garage, Freiburger and Dulcich attack those demons, have a lot of fun in the process, and return to the drag strip in the hunt for the elusive 11-second timeslip.",

It’s sweet, but it has not been on the road since 1995, and Freiburger’s on a deadline to drive it up to the Southern California Timing Association’s land speed races at El Mirage Dry Lake so he can work patrol duty…and then do some four-wheeling with the old beast that’s now known as the Flannel Wagon.",

This time on Roadkill Garage, the truck gets a mini-makeover in preparation for the 2016 Hot Rod Power Tour. Some of the planned changes are designed for better highway cruising, but there's an important question to be answered: is the Muscle Truck still capable of massive burnouts for distance? Of course we find that out the fun way in Roadkill Garage episode 6. Thanks to LMC Truck and Jegs for product support on this episode.",

And even if people did slice up desirable muscle cars, they’d be smarter than Freiburger and Dulcich and wouldn’t drive them into a lava flow during a 100-year sandstorm that strips paint, shreds skin, and tears up eyeballs. Ah, but there’s no glory without suffering, and this time on Roadkill Garage, there’s plenty of glory.

On this episode, he’s going to attack David Freiburger’s 1970 Plymouth known as the Crop Duster and show you his techniques for quick-and-dirty body repair with fantastic results—but not until he manages to get the car up on three wheels while hooning around. As longtime followers know, initiating paintwork can be the death knell for a Dulcich-Freiburger project car, but this time Dulcich swears the Crop Duster will be back on the road in no time. This is Part 1 of the paint and body series. Look for Part 2 about painting and detailing the car.",

Meanwhile, watch David Freiburger and Péwé struggle with the obscure 327ci Rambler V-8 in the old Jeep. They’ll also grapple with Freiburger’s original concept of turning this rig into the DRAGoneer, a weirdo of a sleeper drag-racing machine; could the “Waggy” just be too good to tear up, Roadkill style?

It packs a 550hp, 400ci, tunnel-rammed small-block engine; a trick TH350 transmission from Gearstar; a Gear Vendors Overdrive unit; and 4.57 rear gears.

On Roadkill Garage Episode 15, you were introduced to this Mopar Muscle Truck, a shortbed stepside that we loaded with a 500hp, 360ci small-block before taking it drag racing at Roadkill’s first-ever Zip-Tie Drags. After that, Steve Dulcich drove the truck everywhere for months, including using it for tow duty. Unfortunately, after the Dodge was used to haul the Crusher Camaro to the track one day, it had a massive meltdown, when a hole appeared in a cylinder wall. Dulcich removed the 360 and installed a 400hp, 318ci engine to keep the truck in service. David Freiburger couldn’t allow that, downgrading the Mopar Muscle Truck to the Mopar Yoga-Class Truck. Watch the action on this episode as the guys install a fresh, 550hp, 408ci engine! Were the truck’s other dragstrip deficiencies addressed? Of course not!

Problems? The blower was worn out and the brakes barely stopped. Also, after a summer out on the show circuit, some wiring was sketchy and the engine started to run super lean.

                    "overview": "“Station wagons: there is no finer American institution.” That’s what David Freiburger wrote way back in 1998 as the editor of Car Craft magazine. Twenty years later, it’s still true! Hot rodders love old station wagons, and surprisingly, many models can still be purchased cheaply. That’s proven in this episode of Roadkill Garage as Freiburger scores a 1968 Chrysler Town & Country wagon for $1,800—and it has a 440ci big-block for power! It’s soon dubbed the Gargantuwagon. Freiburger and Steve Dulcich show you how to give any old car a basic once-over before they also teach you how to give one a good thrashing without really hurting much. Soon it becomes clear that Dulcich’s 1967 Pontiac Bonneville wagon from Episode 11 needs to come play along—and if two full-size American land barges are good, then three are better as Lucky Costa from the HOT ROD Garage show jumps in with his 1966 Plymouth Fury wagon loaded with 512ci of big-block power!",

It was a perfect excuse for a vintage-truck adventure where you’ll also learn how to tune a Holley carb on the fly.

As for engine and trans, the guys could use the 400hp 318ci small-block that was removed from the Mopar Muscle Truck on Episode 15 of Roadkill Garage.

The initial plan was to toss it into Freiburger’s ’66 Buick convertible, but watch the episode and you'll see why that fell through. Instead—exhibiting no fear of crossbreeding—the guys put the big Buick into Roadkill Garage’s ’66 Malibu known as the Crew Cab Chevelle!

The Clevo Commando will take months to finish, but we’re kicking off the project on this episode that gives you a gander at the weirdo Jeep as we hack the sheetmetal to clear big Bogger tires, then give you the buildup recipe for a 406ci Cleveland that proves its power with bigger numbers on the dyno than even expected, even from guest-star Steve Brulé of Engine Masters.

On a fateful day seen on Roadkill Extra, Episode 368, Steve Dulcich blew up the rearend in the FMT and it’s been sitting untouched ever since.

Of course the show closes with some traditional Roadkill Garage exhibitions of speed, but this isn’t the last you’ll see of the Vanishing Paint: stick with Motor Trend Premium to see an upcoming episode of Roadkill, where Freiburger and Dulcich will finish the suspension and hit the road to meet up with Tire Rack at an SCCA autocross!",

After all, you really have to get a hot rod on the road before you can tell if you’re in love or not. The guys hit some roadblocks with compression issues that send their heads spinning but manage to eventually get it on the road.

The guys have mastered the American engine; now it’s time they take on something new, or at least new to them. The “Boon Duggy” has a German-engineered four-cylinder 1200 boxer engine boasting a furious 40 horsepower and a four-speed transaxle. There’s only one problem—it’s been sitting around for years and may not even run. Will the guys’ knowledge of V-8s translate to VWs, or will they figure out how to overheat an air-cooled engine?

It survived the 100-year sandstorm that nearly killed David Freiburger and Steve Dulcich, but the E-Body’s 318 engine wasn’t so fortunate–turns out cylinders don’t just self-bore when a pound of sand makes it through the carb. After two years of neglect on the farm, the guys finally get the ORC back into working order with a fresh 360 powerplant and 727 trans from a $1,500 parts truck. If just getting it back up and running wasn’t victory enough, the guys decide to put it to the test in a mud drag race against their blown small-block, Chevy-powered Jeep CJ-5. Will the Off-Road Challenger’s new heart survive another beating and out-mud the Jeep? Find out on this episode of Roadkill Garage.",
