The writers' previous successes with The Rag Trade and Meet the Wife were for the BBC, but the corporation rejected On the Buses, not seeing much comedy potential in a bus depot as a setting. The comedy partnership turned to a friend, Frank Muir, Head of Entertainment at London Weekend Television, who loved the idea; the show was accepted and despite a poor critical reception became a hit with viewers.","popularity":8.204,"poster_path":"/dFXI5MJ1L0VH6rOtJ3FzT36lCaS.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6197,"logo_path":"/6LFn6YTFLtqNFkWw85csFErB2dv.png","name":"LWT","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1971-04-29","episode_count":3,"id":2305,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1969-02-28","episode_count":7,"id":2301,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/dCjzPYvZsKwkoiY2lDVfzkxmsYW.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":6.8},{"air_date":"1969-05-31","episode_count":6,"id":2302,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/rT1aTtTNLlysiv1wDXN16r4W5yB.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":7.7},{"air_date":"1970-01-02","episode_count":13,"id":2299,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/v5KsGevBNHotedEjzIZRT4pMFbd.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1970-11-27","episode_count":13,"id":2298,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/h4jmalVIYK3xz3Pg2OWF4Lb62Vp.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1971-09-19","episode_count":15,"id":2303,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/zZTDJiq9Zj8Ih4m3Hx8qhBSAlCa.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1972-02-20","episode_count":7,"id":2300,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":"/bcOhyDLtX2jfOukt4PR5vCAVteF.jpg","season_number":6,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1973-02-02","episode_count":13,"id":2304,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":"/1kbrDg8wY87JtThHPU25eyC8DPN.jpg","season_number":7,"vote_average":7}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.25,"vote_count":24,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5253958a19c29579402c7b27","air_date":"1969-02-28","episodes":[{"air_date":"1969-02-28","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":42335,"name":"The Early Shift","overview":"The bus crews go on strike because of disagreements with the management.
