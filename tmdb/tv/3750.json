Meanwhile, Christian is having problems with picky Gina, who is trying to keep Christian away from baby Wilbur, because it isn't his baby. Having his own problems with age, he is rejected by a 25-year old at a bar. Christian decides to hire a nanny, who he ends up having sex with, and later learns that she is giving the baby drugs to keep it from crying. Christian tries to convince Sean to have botox, but he refuses (at first). They perform surgery on a woman who was shot in the face nine months earlier. She is brought along by her gay friend. The two are having problems because the woman loves Chad, but Chad doesn't love her in that way, because he's in love with his boyfriend. We learn that Chad and the woman were planning on shooting each other, but she couldn't pull the trigger, so Chad was left unharmed.\n\nDuring Erica's facelift, Sean panics and can't do it. Christian is having some trouble too - he's slept with Erica, the night of Sean and Julia's wedding. The surgery continues. Later that day, Christian is having problems with Wilbur, so he calls Julia to come help him.

Sean tells Julia that he keeps trying to forgive her and wants to try to love her again, but that it wouldn't happen right away.\n\nJulia has an adverse reaction to the anesthesia and dreams during her surgery. Ava shows up in her dream as a different form of life coach, and guides her through this surreal life. Julia is married to Christian, which seems happy on the outside, but is really falling apart on the inside. They run the Troy/Troy partnership firm. When Christian decides to leave the practice, Julia interviews another doctor - Sean, someone she knew from high school. Trying to catch up on old times, Sean invites Julia and Christian to dinner. They meet his wife, Megan O'Hara, and their son Matt, who is on the nerdy side and has a bug collection. Megan is three months pregnant with a girl they plan on calling Annie, named after his grandmother. Julia is upset after a visit to Liz, an OB/GYN in this world, who has two kids. Julia cannot have kids with Christian, who wanted to have a biological child since he was adopted. Kimber, Julia and Christian's three-way partner becomes pregnant, and Christian refuses to get rid of it. We are revisited by several characters, including Mrs. Grubman, Jude, and Julia's friend Suzanne.\n\nWhen Julia wakes up in recovery, Sean is there waiting for her. She has realized that things would never work out with Christian, and that Sean was always the one she loved.","production_code":"177612","runtime":44,"season_number":2,"show_id":3750,"still_path":"/5QAsV7n0g19TiSSNHNEotDsX7ZL.jpg","vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525755ca760ee36aaa22c065","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112548,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael M.

The women all have adverse reactions to it, and one of them comes in to have it fixed because bulges have formed on her forehead. Bobolit has now partnered with Madam Rose, who owns a chain of beauty salons. He performs unsanitary plastic surgery for lower prices in her basement, and they proudly promote this new invented \"Bobotox\". Christian tries to talk some sense into him, and eventually learns that Merrill is hooked on the anesthesia, and is constantly high on it - even during surgery. Christian acts as his sponsor in an AA-type rehabilitation group. Merrill becomes furious with Christian after a girl he wanted flirts with Christian.\n\nMeanwhile, Matt gets upset at Adrian for wearing his leather coat to school while soliciting drugs to other students. After Adrian refuses to give him the coat back, they get into a fist fight. Since the coat belongs to Matt, the drugs in the pocket are pinned on him. Christian is called in instead of Sean along with Ava, and Ava comes up with the idea to bribe the principal, Ms. Wentworth, with pro bono plastic surgery. After getting off free because of the surgery, Adrian and Matt decide to be friends. While having a conversation in the bathroom at school, Adrian urinates in one of the soap dispensers, and both Matt and Adrian get called to the principal's office again. Sean comes in this time along with Ava, and he forces the truth out of Adrian and Matt, and snaps at Ava. Sean punishes Matt by sentencing him to spending his afternoons at the office doing handiwork and cleaning. Matt realizes he likes spending time there.\n\nAdrian has had the last straw with Ava's harsh treatment, and they share a meaningful moment as mother and son, but it turns weird when they begin to make out.","production_code":"177613","runtime":44,"season_number":2,"show_id":3750,"still_path":"/eDwkTVWWABXjntvSB0iDYcZDSgV.jpg","vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525755ca760ee36aaa22c277","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":41258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer Salt","original_name":"Jennifer Salt","popularity":11.921,"profile_path":"/zVF2q7szi2Ga0kgAA6TEQMO77la.jpg"},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525755ce760ee36aaa22c537","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1216736,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Brazil","original_name":"Scott Brazil","popularity":2.107,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525755ca760ee36aaa22c039","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1218121,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Sean Jablonski","original_name":"Sean Jablonski","popularity":1.214,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"525755d5760ee36aaa22ceeb","order":516,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":38888,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Gabel","original_name":"Seth Gabel","popularity":8.604,"profile_path":"/kY5UB2E1Rr08ikaa48om4x5ZV8Z.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525755c9760ee36aaa22bee7","order":552,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9998,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joey Slotnick","original_name":"Joey Slotnick","popularity":10.006,"profile_path":"/AbQMBdomzhuqKC27LVWkurWfIms.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525755d4760ee36aaa22cbca","order":607,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":10696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Famke Janssen","original_name":"Famke Janssen","popularity":32.671,"profile_path":"/uvZGwNsLqe9NyA57Qlt46IkO8Bd.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525755d8760ee36aaa22d525","order":668,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1212210,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Zilah Mendoza","original_name":"Zilah Mendoza","popularity":3.275,"profile_path":"/z1nhf4nGk480SLfWAtl1dFncIrQ.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"525755d8760ee36aaa22d54f","order":690,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":157865,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Karen Maruyama","original_name":"Karen Maruyama","popularity":4.143,"profile_path":"/6XCu6ZFSkF8ppMO40Jx6HgDKJgj.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2004-09-21","episode_number":14,"episode_type":"standard","id":263197,"name":"Trudy Nye","overview":"Sean and Christian repair the face of a woman abused by her husband; Sean and Julia confront Ava about her relationship with her son Adrian.","production_code":"177614","runtime":44,"season_number":2,"show_id":3750,"still_path":"/gLzvXW5xNKVyJ3ZruWqzDfNXWhA.jpg","vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525755ca760ee36aaa22c181","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":154528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elodie Keene","original_name":"Elodie Keene","popularity":2.021,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"525755d8760ee36aaa22d59f","order":506,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"T.J.
