If the investors like an idea, they're ready to invest their own cash to kick-start the business. But if they don't like it, expect drama as the dragons show no mercy and tell the budding entrepreneur in no uncertain terms to stop wasting their time.\n\nThe investors are confronted by an innovation in pub snacks, branded underwear, a solution to rolling beer bottles in the fridge, a wi-fi business aimed at yachties and many more. Will anyone leave the den with the cash they need to launch their business dreams?",

The answer? Very.\n\nWe also catch up with some of Deborah's Den investments and discover how the businesses are developing with a dragon on board. One of Deborah's most memorable investments, Sarah Lu and her You Doo Doll, has developed into a full range of products including a You Doo Dog. Deborah's killer heels don't get in the way as she climbs aboard an HGV truck with another den investment, JPM Logistics, as they ferry topiary elephants around London; and we're with recycling company ProWaste in the first few weeks and months of dealing with a dragon outside the Den.",

Having grown up in the shadow of the shipyards of Clydebank, he makes an emotional visit to the local pub where he used to play dominoes with his father and talks about some of the events that shaped his life. We see a very different side to the tough-talking, plain-speaking dragon as he explains how his unconventional CV is ideal for anyone who wants to be a successful entrepreneur.\n\nWe are with Bannatyne's family as they holiday in their luxurious villa in the Cote D'Azure, track his business career to find out where he made his millions, but also discover that his straight talking manner is unsuprisingly not confined to the den.\n\nWe also trace some of his most memorable den investments and find out what happened once the deal was done - from the all-singing, all-dancing Razzmatazz franchises, through to the successful logistics company Igloo and the electrical wiring connector that is selling in the millions and has turned its inventor Peter Moule into a mini-dragon in his own right.",

These are challenging times economically, but that hasn't deterred the nation's entrepreneurs from pitting their wits against the multimillionaire investors. In this series, a record number of entrepreneurs walk up the famous stairs to ask for an all-important cash injection that could transform their businesses and change their lives.\n\nThe rival multimillionaires may be used to the odd glass of something sparkling, but Devon-based vineyard owner Geoff Bowen hopes his unusual business proposition will tempt them into investing. Inventor Derek Cozens thinks that road signs are so last century and wants to drag them into 2010 with his new product range. Do Dragons have a sweet tooth? One 24-year-old mum from Preston, Kirsty Henshaw, hopes they do and that it's the best way to get the cash she needs for her frozen pudding business.\n\nIt wouldn't be Dragons' Den without a product getting tested to destruction, and calling a product 'safe' is like a red rag to a bull for one particular Dragon.",

Having scrimped, saved and self-sacrificed in the haulage industry to make her own fortune, Hilary has her own views on the products and businesses brought before her, and she's more than happy to take on her rivals in order to get the best deal.\n\n34-year-old Georgette Hewitt, from Kent, finds out exactly how nerve-wracking it can be to climb those famous stairs and pitch to the Dragons. It's a real battle to compose her nerves, but one she must win in order to tempt the multimillionaires to invest in her answer to a common birthday party headache familiar to all parents. Entrepreneurs often take advantage of the latest government schemes and incentives when building their business, which is exactly what Chris Hopkins from Yorkshire has done by capitalising on the solar power feed-in tariff. But when a Dragon knows your industry inside out it's not always what you want. Add into the mix the most unusual use you could ever think of for a plastic egg, a circus act that's sure to go with a bang, and a mind coaching massage service, and you've got a formidable showcase of the Great British spirit of invention and innovation.\n\nAs ever Evan Davis is on hand to dissect the events, with further action and reaction available through the Red Button.",

The Dragons are often happy to demo a product but it is the business and how it makes money that remains their ultimate concern. Husband and wife team Liz and Alan Colleran from Dewsbury may be pitching their comfy caravan product - but will their Den experience be quite so luxurious and comfortable?\n\nElsewhere, an Englishman, a Norwegian and a Scot walk into the Den. Shades for canines are on offer, there's an inflatable car-based device like you have never seen before and a Kent-based entrepreneur thinks honesty is the best policy when pitching without a formal business plan - but with an offer to help everyone get the perfect looking body for just 20 pounds.\n\nWith further interviews and reaction available via the Red Button at the end of the programme.",

Will the pair's futuristic demonstration be enough to secure the cash they desperately need, or will the investors spot a fatal flaw? A beauty lover from Birmingham pitches possibly the smallest product ever seen in the Den, and a Lancastrian father of three has some explaining to do when his business building wooden huts comes under close scrutiny from the five multimillionaires. Other ideas seeking investment in Den include a multi-directional paint brush, a solution to the troublesome problem of 'pillow slippage' and a taxi driver's security invention, which is put through the Theo Paphitis break test.",

A ballroom dancer turned inventor brings a bit of sparkle into the Den via a tango and a glitter ball; Theo Paphitis and Peter Jones crawl into a new concept for the camping industry; and a labrador called Margot helps to sell the idea of doggy ice cream.
