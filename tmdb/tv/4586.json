Although Rory tees off to a rocky start, she soon gets into the swing of things and has a great time walking and talking with Richard. Later, Lorelai's mixed feelings as Rory tells her how much she enjoyed being with Richard at the club provokes her into an intensely stupid argument with Rory, which is soon patched up when Lorelai realizes that she's not losing Rory to her parents. At the Inn, Lorelai has her hands full overseeing all the preparations for an ornate double wedding ceremony and contending with a pair of spoiled and quarrelsome twin brides, their exhausted mother, their twin grooms, Michel, and the rest of her staff.","production_code":"226702","runtime":43,"season_number":1,"show_id":4586,"still_path":"/2IrZ4ZFDg9oe5aL72YeNDgAhtpz.jpg","vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":12,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52577297760ee36aaa4bd347","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1237280,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joanne Waters","original_name":"Joanne Waters","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52577297760ee36aaa4bd379","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1216745,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Adam Nimoy","original_name":"Adam Nimoy","popularity":8.707,"profile_path":"/9XSnEwBPofm5vg7XTLdyY6TDsID.jpg"},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52577292760ee36aaa4bcc42","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":15798,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Lesli Linka Glatter","original_name":"Lesli Linka Glatter","popularity":2.842,"profile_path":"/8F13UPsRnXWTDcp8iA3ZXMtfJa3.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52577291760ee36aaa4bcab6","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1222946,"known_for_department":"Creator","name":"Amy Sherman-Palladino","original_name":"Amy Sherman-Palladino","popularity":3.312,"profile_path":"/v8OGBnKfmnfvlPhkluiRo5fkpQM.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Drella","credit_id":"52577295760ee36aaa4bd2b6","order":512,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":24357,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Alex Borstein","original_name":"Alex Borstein","popularity":18.211,"profile_path":"/evbCnRe5Yfuy0B41PONLTIcvbem.jpg"},{"character":"Babette Dell","credit_id":"5257728e760ee36aaa4bc649","order":517,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":49352,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sally Struthers","original_name":"Sally Struthers","popularity":19.117,"profile_path":"/j0PBlvoZkT9fZw8v9HpzgZKhJ4s.jpg"},{"character":"Patty LaCosta","credit_id":"5257728e760ee36aaa4bc799","order":697,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":55549,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Liz Torres","original_name":"Liz Torres","popularity":4.712,"profile_path":"/gGPWtG1ZbtZC73w9zjUED26jZIH.jpg"},{"character":"Morey Dell","credit_id":"60a3dd48764b990040a14eda","order":746,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":154263,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ted Rooney","original_name":"Ted Rooney","popularity":2.568,"profile_path":"/jTEBUeogTL3bqCIRAzy7zc7R5CA.jpg"},{"character":"Jackson Belleville","credit_id":"60a3dfddf9183a00797c7598","order":752,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94269,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jackson Douglas","original_name":"Jackson Douglas","popularity":9.104,"profile_path":"/4AZPta58TWI2rU1taiZosl5Ol4j.jpg"},{"character":"Mrs. Shales","credit_id":"63fef3937a4ee7008639a24f","order":766,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":82988,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meagen Fay","original_name":"Meagen Fay","popularity":10.133,"profile_path":"/scvzl6Ym40hdIx8yYBOw9TrlXPM.jpg"},{"character":"Nanette","credit_id":"63fef454699fb7007d8e674d","order":767,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1497253,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Eileen Barnett","original_name":"Eileen Barnett","popularity":2.951,"profile_path":"/yCeboWWHT9L5wM81TSO3YaeECc0.jpg"},{"character":"Julian Johnson","credit_id":"63fef4649653f600894e6f94","order":768,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141052,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charles C.

In her panic to get to school on time, Rory gets into a car accident -- she gets hit by a deer who runs into Lorelai's car at a stop sign.  When she walks into class late, Max tells her that she can't take the test, and Rory has a meltdown, finally giving Paris and Tristan the chewing out they so richly deserve.
