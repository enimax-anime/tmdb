For generations they've used rod and reel to catch the elusive bluefin tuna. They depend on these fish for their livelihood, and the competition is brutal. Over the next 10 weeks, the most skilled fishermen will set out in the frigid waters of the North Atlantic in hopes of catching the valuable bluefin tuna. When one bluefin can bring in as much as $20,000—they'll do whatever it takes to hook up.",

TJ expects that, in return, Dave will alert him if the fish are still biting in his hot spot, but Dave hasn't earned the nickname \"Tricky Dave\" for nothing.
