Rick Hunter and Stepfanie Kramer as Sgt. Dee Dee McCall, which ran on NBC from 1984 to 1991. However, Kramer left after the sixth season to pursue other acting and musical opportunities. In the seventh season, Hunter partnered with two different women officers. The titular character, Sgt. Rick Hunter, was a wily, physically imposing, and often rule-breaking homicide detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. The show's main characters, Hunter and McCall, resolve many of their cases by shooting dead the perpetrators.\n\nThe show's executive producer during the first season was Stephen J. Cannell, whose company produced the series.","popularity":38.193,"poster_path":"/kmC8d3KQozh1SlIih0hdfXsGLe8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5585,"logo_path":null,"name":"Stephen J.
