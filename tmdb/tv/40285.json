In New Zealand it screens on Prime Television.\n\nThe ten part series is written by Ian David, Mac Gudgeon, Katherine Thompson and Shaun Grant. The executive producer is Jason Stephens.

At the top of his game, Fraser commanded a huge salary and lived the dream whilst defending the most controversial criminals that Australia has ever seen. His ethical ambiguity, cocaine addiction and believing bullshit, finally caught up with him and he lost everything. He was disbarred, discredited, financially bankrupt and spent five years in a maximum security prison for drug smuggling. Killing Time is a fascinating insight into the brutal upheavals of the Australian justice system when the war between the criminal class and a corrupt police force finally became public..","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":40285,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52595c9f760ee3466192a7ad","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":94878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Peter
