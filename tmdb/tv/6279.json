It originally aired for one season in 1997.\n\nIn ancient Egypt, an evil sorcerer named Scarab, kills the pharaoh's son, Prince Rapses, so he can become immortal. Entombed alive for his crime, Scarab revives in the modern world and begins his search for Rapses' reincarnation, a San Francisco-dwelling boy named Presley Carnovan to retrieve the spirit of Rapses' so he can become immortal. Rapses' bodyguards, Ja-Kal, Rath, Armon, and Nefer-Tina, along with Rapses' cat, Kahti, awake from the dead to protect him from Scarab. They use the power of Ra to transform into powerful guardians.\n\nEach of the mummies is aligned with the power of an Egyptian god. Ja-Kal uses the spirit of falcon, Rath uses the spirit of snake, Armon uses the spirit of ram, and Nefer-Tina uses the spirit of cat. They are able to call upon it for magical armor and powers to fight superhuman evildoers. Although, once their strength is exhausted, they must rest in their sarcophagi to regain the ability. In order to access these powers, the mummies call out the phrase \"With the Strength of Ra!\", which triggers their transformation. The mummies also have the power to make a horrifying face, usually used to scare away nosy bystanders.","popularity":6.578,"poster_path":"/qe7efkAYp0p2qLXtuwgcuJkSxlU.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1997-09-15","episode_count":42,"id":16429,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/HznUeWX8K9V4dKmXGpgEv5u5HW.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":25,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52578599760ee36aaa62ebef","air_date":"1997-09-15","episodes":[{"air_date":"1997-09-15","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":373364,"name":"Ra, Ra, Ra, Ra","overview":"Scarab grabs for Presley, the Mummies appear to protect him, Nefertina is revealed to be a female, and the stage is set.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":6279,"still_path":"/fVWebs9bHJEF8xA5QyVpArOut2Z.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1997-09-16","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":373359,"name":"Sleep Walk Like an Egyptian","overview":"Scarab's mysterious scorpion puts Presley into a dreamlike state.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":6279,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1997-09-17","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":373361,"name":"Pack to the Future","overview":"Scarab sends a pack of animal spirits after Presley, who is out camping with his mom.
