In 2001, author Michael Peterson was arraigned for the murder of his wife Kathleen, whose body was discovered lying in a pool of blood on the stairway of their home. Granted unusual access to Peterson's lawyers, home and immediate family, de Lestrade's cameras capture the defense team as it considers its strategic options. The series is an engrossing look at contemporary American justice that features more twists than a legal bestseller.","popularity":17.827,"poster_path":"/djPx89ayJ9rmVXRMDCaBlGQkzkv.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":40409,"logo_path":null,"name":"Maha Productions","origin_country":"FR"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"FR","name":"France"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":10,"id":31211,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2004-10-07","episode_count":13,"id":31210,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/qINhv4LcDvA6XlYXujaZXfPB0s6.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7.5}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Documentary","vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":139,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52586769760ee3466118c1d5","air_date":"2004-10-07","episodes":[{"air_date":"2004-10-07","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":595513,"name":"Crime or Accident?","overview":"Following his wife's suspicious death, Michael Peterson speaks about his version of the events while lawyers and expert witnesses prepare for trial.","production_code":"","runtime":49,"season_number":1,"show_id":21421,"still_path":"/rAMUtolT2YPB9qJAEzpHHtr33GA.jpg","vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":5,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-10-07","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":595514,"name":"Secrets and Lies","overview":"As Michael's hidden life comes out into the open, defense experts debate if it will have a significant impact on the coming trial.","production_code":"","runtime":49,"season_number":1,"show_id":21421,"still_path":"/u3sGQVOBb3lYYC2ZZha7o53pxMp.jpg","vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":5,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2004-10-14","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":595515,"name":"A Striking Coincidence","overview":"The death of another woman close to Peterson from 17 years earlier sparks a new investigation.
