Bash investigates not just what the attacks against Jews are but why they are so pervasive right now.  Antisemitism and its conspiracies and tropes run deep in society and has for millennia, but in modern times it has largely festered beneath the surface. In America, that changed in the last ten years with extremists from the hard right feeling emboldened by the political climate. But antisemitism has also been brewing on the hard left, masquerading as political free speech, especially at America's elite universities.",

Despite warnings that sharks are endangered globally, some fishermen say the shark population in the US is out of control, and the rate at which sharks are feasting on their catch is crippling the fishing industry. However, some scientists disagree, arguing that depredation may be due to overfishing and depleting prey sources. Sanchez speaks with parties on both sides of the issue, bringing their concerns to government regulators and even free dives with the sharks himself.",
