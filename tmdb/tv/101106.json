That same day, he was found dead in the backyard of a home. A coroner was unable to pinpoint a cause of death because his injuries were so severe. The only witnesses? A group of Vancouver police officers responding to a nuisance call about a man spraying a woman with a garden hose. An independent investigation recommended charges, but none were laid. It's taken Myles Gray’s family eight years to fight for justice for him - and find the truth.",
