Participants must forage for their own food, build shelter, and overcome both physical and mental obstacles while self-recording their journey for a chance to be the last person standing and win the coveted $500,000 cash prize. With no teams, no camera crews, and no gimmicks, \"Alone\" displays the grit of human endurance and is the ultimate test of human will.",
