Night Shyamalan begins with U.S. Secret Service agent Ethan Burke awakening from a car accident trapped in the seemingly idyllic, but secretly insidious, town of Wayward Pines, Idaho. It soon becomes clear that this peculiar Northwest hamlet is quite literally impossible to leave. The phones don't make outgoing calls, it's surrounded by an electric fence and the residents are under constant camera surveillance. Nobody is supposed to talk about the past or question the present. And anyone who tries to escape is punished via a public execution called a reckoning. With a history of mental illness and hallucinations, Ethan begins to question his own sanity as he investigates this tight-knit community, which includes fellow agent and former lover Kate Hewson, who has developed the façade of a Stepford spouse in order to ensure her survival. Before long, Ethan is reunited with his wife Theresa and son Ben, but now they too are stuck in this place where nothing is as it seems and no one can be trusted.","poster_path":"/nU3OLWfG1F32eJzhISIZbWYzZNr.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7.8},{"air_date":"2016-05-25","episode_count":10,"id":75090,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/8oo7PJcBEO39PvUalPlwpt2C3mh.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":6.1}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"One road in.

Crouch and executive produced by M. Night Shyamalan begins with U.S. Secret Service agent Ethan Burke awakening from a car accident trapped in the seemingly idyllic, but secretly insidious, town of Wayward Pines, Idaho. It soon becomes clear that this peculiar Northwest hamlet is quite literally impossible to leave. The phones don't make outgoing calls, it's surrounded by an electric fence and the residents are under constant camera surveillance. Nobody is supposed to talk about the past or question the present. And anyone who tries to escape is punished via a public execution called a reckoning. With a history of mental illness and hallucinations, Ethan begins to question his own sanity as he investigates this tight-knit community, which includes fellow agent and former lover Kate Hewson, who has developed the façade of a Stepford spouse in order to ensure her survival. Before long, Ethan is reunited with his wife Theresa and son Ben, but now they too are stuck in this place where nothing is as it seems and no one can be trusted.","id":62271,"poster_path":"/nU3OLWfG1F32eJzhISIZbWYzZNr.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7.8},"2":{"_id":"56d8e09392514175a3004e54","air_date":"2016-05-25","episodes":[{"air_date":"2016-05-25","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1173454,"name":"Enemy Lines","overview":"Dr. Theo Yedlin – a new resident of Wayward Pines – awakens from suspended animation and finds himself in the middle of this rebellion, as he tries to understand what Wayward Pines really is and help preserve the endangered human race.
