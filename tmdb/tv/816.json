Jack is joined by glamorous actress Tamzin Outhwaite and Stone Roses' legendary bassist Mani. Ulrika is joined by stand-up comic Micky Flanagan and comedy actor turned author Charlie Higson.\n\nAngelos Epithemiou keeps an eye on proceedings and gives out the scores to each team as well as performing a very special rap at the start of the show. Meanwhile Vic shows off his cool new piercings and Bob shows off his pet buzzard, Phillip. During the end game, Tamzin comes face to face with a very special beast, which was specially bred for the show.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"2011-09-12","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":8,"show_id":816,"still_path":null},"name":"Shooting Stars","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":126,"logo_path":"/lBk6aoAEPdbtnhR4H3eouQVq9Dp.png","name":"BBC Choice","origin_country":"GB"},{"id":332,"logo_path":"/6kl5tMuct7u3ej5myL4c9QQVSW1.png","name":"BBC Two","origin_country":"GB"}],"number_of_episodes":70,"number_of_seasons":8,"origin_country":["GB"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Shooting Stars","overview":"Shooting Stars is a British television comedy panel game broadcast on BBC Two as a pilot in 1993, then as 3 full series from 1995 to 1997, then on BBC Choice from January to December 2002 with 2 series before returning to BBC Two for another 3 series from 2008 until its cancellation in 2011. Created and hosted by double-act Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer, it uses the panel show format but with the comedians' often slapstick, surreal and anarchic humour does not rely on rules in order to function, with the pair apparently ignoring existing rules or inventing new ones as and when the mood takes
