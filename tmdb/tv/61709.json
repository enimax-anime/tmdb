But as the match goes on, he learns more and more, and more and more of his hidden power is released until he is able to go toe to toe with Goku in his base state (without Goku powering up). When Goku does power up slightly (in his normal state) Uub nearly falls out of the ring, but Goku saves him from hitting the ground. He realizes that Uub doesn't even know how to fly, so Goku decides to train him. Despite his friends and family pleading with Goku to stay, he flies away with Uub on his back. Goku decides to train Uub to defend the Earth when he's gone. He hopes one day, when Uub's training is complete, to have a real all-out match with him to test their power. Goku and Uub fly off into the distance with whoops of joy.","vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"air_date":"2015-06-28","episode_number":26,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":26,"season_number":6,"show_id":61709,"still_path":"/2bZBeqeDGPil7uK9kILEbFCIU1G.jpg"},"name":"Dragon Ball Z Kai","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":1,"logo_path":"/yS5UJjsSdZXML0YikWTYYHLPKhQ.png","name":"Fuji TV","origin_country":"JP"}],"number_of_episodes":158,"number_of_seasons":6,"origin_country":["JP"],"original_language":"ja","original_name":"ドラゴンボール改「カイ」","overview":"Rejoin Goku and his friends in a series of cosmic battles!

Just before it hits, it is deflected by Tien's Tri-Beam attack, who has decided to help, even though he is terribly outclassed. Buu tries again, but Goku suddenly appears and sends a disk of energy at the monster. It cuts off his legs and part of his head. His legs deal Tien a crushing kick which completely incapacitates him and then they return to Buu. Desperate to stop Majin Buu, Goku throws Gohan the other earring, but his aim is off and the earring is lost in the rubble. Goku goes Super Saiyan 3 in an attempt to hold Buu off while Gohan searches for the earring.

After Goku finds Vegeta, Goku tries to convince him to fuse, but Vegeta is angry at Goku because he knows Goku was holding back his Super Saiyan 3 transformation when they fought. With Vegeta refusing to cooperate, they are forced to take on Buu as individuals, but are clearly outclassed. Goku tells Vegeta that Buu absorbed Trunks and killed Bulma and asks him to put their differences aside to save their people.

He deals a lot of damage to Buu, but as the fight goes on, his hits become weaker and weaker until they have virtually no effect at all. He tells Vegeta that it's his turn, but Vegeta declines, deciding that he is no match for Buu. He tells Goku that Buu is too powerful for him and that Goku stands a much better chance of destroying him. Goku is shocked and unsettled by this admission, telling Vegeta that he deliberately let the fight drag on so that Vegeta could have a turn, and that now he is exhausted. Vegeta is horrified by this, because now they cannot stop Buu. Goku unsuccessfully attempts to reassure Vegeta, telling him that he needs one uninterrupted minute to power up enough to destroy Buu. Despite the fact that Vegeta recognizes that he will need a miracle to survive a minute against Buu now, he reluctantly steps in while Goku is powering up, even though Goku tells him that if he is destroyed when he is already dead, Vegeta will no longer exist in any form. Buu thrashes Vegeta, but every time he gets knocked down, Vegeta gets up, ready for more. Buu stretches out his arm, wraps it around Vegeta's neck, and begins choking him for fun. It's been more than one minute, but Goku still hasn't generated the power he needs.","production_code":"","runtime":26,"season_number":6,"show_id":61709,"still_path":"/33eR1MhcSkbvUK4ZHgd9KMB898H.jpg","vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2015-05-24","episode_number":21,"episode_type":"standard","id":1094699,"name":"A Secret Plan Comes Together in a Flash - Please Grant These Two Wishes!","overview":"Fat Majin Buu enters the fight, saving Vegeta from death.

Porunga is summoned, and Vegeta tells Dende his two wishes: bring back the earth and restore it to its undamaged state, and bring back all of the non-evil people that died since the morning of the World Martial Arts Tournament.

Now Goku asks the earthlings to raise up their arms and donate some of their energy, and small pockets of people who recognize his voice or just like the sound of it do so, but the vast majority remain uninterested. Piccolo, Gohan, Goten, and Trunks spread out into the city, hoping to convince people to raise their arms. Hercule has finally had enough, and he speaks to the people of earth.

Suddenly, Fat Buu gets up and holds Kid Buu down long enough for Hercule to pull Vegeta to safety. Kid Buu kick Fat Buu aside, and Goku throws the Spirit Bomb. It hits Kid Buu, but he starts pushing it back. Goku uses all of the remaining energy he has left trying to push it back into Kid Buu, but he is too powerful. After a brief panic, Vegeta suddenly remembers that they still have a third wish with Porunga. He instructs Dende to wish for Goku's power level to be restored to its normal, healthy level. The wish is granted, and upon turning into a Super Saiyan, Goku is easily able to force the Spirit Bomb back at Kid Buu. As he does so, he silently wishes that Buu had been a better person, and hopes to fight him as a different person, some day in the future. The Spirit Bomb hits with full force, finally destroying the evil, childlike Majin Buu permanently.

The First World Martial Arts Tournament in a Long Time!","overview":"Ten years have passed, and much has changed. Gohan has become a scholar, and Trunks and Goten are in their late teens. Goku is training with Goten when Bulma and Vegeta, who have a new daughter, Bulla, show up after not seeing him in five years. Goku says that he and Goten will be entering the World Martial Arts Tournament, so Vegeta says that he and Trunks will do the same. The day of the tournament comes, and old friends catch up. Everyone has arrived to watch. Gohan, who is now married to Videl, has decided not to enter, but his daughter, Pan, will fight. Since there is no junior division this time, she will be fighting with the adults. Hercule and Buu will also be fighting. However, Goku says that there is someone who is 100% human that can threaten to beat him and Vegeta. The seeding draw for the tournament begins, and Goku asks Majin Buu to use his magic to rig it so that he faces the powerful mystery fighter he had talked about. In the first match, Pan faces Wild Tiger, and the four-year-old easily dispatches him. Next up is Goku against a ten-year-old boy named Uub. Uub is the reincarnation of the evil Kid Majin Buu. King Yemma apparently heard Goku's wish right before the evil Buu was destroyed, and he reincarnated him as a good person named Uub. Uub is apprehensive, so to bait him into fighting, Goku eventually resorts to taunting the young boy. After a particularly nasty insult and a kick to the face, Uub has snapped, and is now ready to fight.","production_code":"","runtime":26,"season_number":6,"show_id":61709,"still_path":"/pdLw1oO3BAm5kt4Ja1o7SiJkfhA.jpg","vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2015-06-28","episode_number":26,"episode_type":"finale","id":1094704,"name":"Even Stronger!
