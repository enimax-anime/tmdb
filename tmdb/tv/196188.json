                    "overview": "The fact that Hitler's niece, Geli Raubal, was found dead in his apartment in 1931 has remained a little-known footnote in the Fuhrers long and bloody legacy. The investigation, carried out in haste and then quickly resolved, concluded that she had committed suicide using her uncle's revolver. But many people have placed doubt on the official verdict, claiming that the truth was covered up by the Nazi party itself. This episode explores the strange and sometimes disturbing relationship between Hitler and Geli. While through dramatic reconstructions, expert interviews and original police files, it investigates whether Geli died at her own hands or was the tragic victim of Hitler's overbearing affections.",

But in 1943, the mysterious murder of one of the wealthiest men in the British empire, Sir Harry Oakes, sparked a chain of events that have led many to believe that the Duke of Windsor had not learned from his mistakes. This episode looks at the persistent rumours accusing the Duke of having been complicit in illegal financial schemes involving laundering Nazi money and influencing the outcome of a murder trial.",

Preparations were made for his execution the next day, but in a final act of defiance, Goering cheated the hangman by deciding his own fate. His suicide shocked the Allies. But it also posed a question, how did he manage to get hold of a cyanide capsule in a heavily guarded maximum-security prison? Had he carried it with him the whole time, concealing it from the extensive and thorough checks carried out by the prison guards? Or had he received help from the very people who were supposed to be guarding him?",
