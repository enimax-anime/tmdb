These star recruits will eat, sleep and train together in punishing conditions, with no allowances made for their celebrity status or gender. An elite team of ex-Special Forces soldiers will subject them to extreme physical endurance, sleep deprivation, interrogation and psychological testing, pushing the stars beyond their limits every step of the way. Some will break and withdraw. Who has what it takes to tough it out to the end? Completely unscripted.",
