Set in outer space, the series followed the adventures of a group of child astronauts, who have acquired a treasure map and have to keep it away from their nemesis, a man named Skyhook and his sidekick Static.\n\nOriginally airing for one season on NBC as a half-hour program and sponsored by General Mills, The Space Kidettes episodes were later edited down to ten-minute episodes and paired with other General Mills-sponsored shows such as Tennessee Tuxedo and Go Go Gophers to form a full half-hour for syndication; edited reruns of cartoons from another NBC Hanna-Barbera program, Samson & Goliath to form the syndication package The Space Kidettes and Young Samson. The original master elements for both programs were lost, leaving the syndicated edits as the only extant broadcast quality versions.\n\nAll 20 episodes of The Space Kidettes and Young Samson were released on DVD via the Warner Archive Collection manufacture-on-demand program in 2011.","popularity":3.174,"poster_path":"/1aUeQ2Lf0nE0dOwFa4VJrW8hlbO.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1966-09-10","episode_count":20,"id":39919,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/vZt07YKJ11weHNoEGJrb4SxR9M4.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"},{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52588f85760ee346614fea4b","air_date":"1966-09-10","episodes":[{"air_date":"1966-09-10","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":710151,"name":"Moleman Menace","overview":"The Kidettes become lost, when they get caught in a space storm, and land on the nearest planet they can find.
