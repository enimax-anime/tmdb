All of a sudden, a member of the program dies a violent death. Nobody knows exactly what happened, and the youths face a difficult decision. Should they wait for the authorities to recover the body and investigate the crime? Or, escape and take their fate into their own hands? The group doesn't have much in common with each other, though one thing unites them; all of them have had really bad experiences with the authorities and donâ€˜t expect to be treated fairly. Since they don't know who the perpetrator is, they only have one option: to run. Up the mountains, up the highest peaks of the Alps. It seems hopeless until they stumble onto a complex cave system where they can find shelter from wind, weather, and their pursuers.","popularity":5.731,"poster_path":"/yrktuA8dfZzGYzbqMEJIskJKKiX.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":32875,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lailaps Pictures","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":96,"logo_path":"/9ps82gVzUeNdkjmLzoGDQLiLDio.png","name":"X Filme Creative Pool","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":171957,"logo_path":null,"name":"Deutsche Telekom","origin_country":""},{"id":46,"logo_path":"/3xFdKHLXPGHEbrAkmsepGE8974Y.png","name":"WDR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":124,"logo_path":"/7MjDMOybX0D3fcIEpCyY9es5XZU.png","name":"SWR","origin_country":"DE"},{"id":98562,"logo_path":null,"name":"handwritten Pictures","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2021-04-15","episode_count":8,"id":190635,"name":"Miniseries","overview":"","poster_path":"/aq0Y8Qpbt5GGZAaaPddZFxnvC18.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":6.6}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"German","iso_639_1":"de","name":"Deutsch"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":6.1,"vote_count":15,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"6077ee501b1f3c006eabd758","air_date":"2021-04-15","episodes":[{"air_date":"2021-04-15","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":2875311,"name":"Kim","overview":"One death occurs during an educational measure with juvenile offenders in the Alps.","production_code":"","runtime":49,"season_number":1,"show_id":123348,"still_path":"/2UwXCBByj6AfUjxXeEB0cXDXs5L.jpg","vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2021-04-15","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":2875312,"name":"Ron","overview":"The young people are faced with a difficult decision: give up or flee?","production_code":"","runtime":48,"season_number":1,"show_id":123348,"still_path":"/ciIwJWgAdCahyCZToXttsHmOyJo.jpg","vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2021-04-22","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":2875314,"name":"Marvin & Jessica","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":50,"season_number":1,"show_id":123348,"still_path":"/8LAJKIbtmjVFlm4QNTGsfwH1Hml.jpg","vote_average":7.5,"vote_count":2,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2021-04-22","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":2875315,"name":"Justin","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":47,"season_number":1,"show_id":123348,"still_path":"/bpSo7DqM6AzF7SxjPzRHcJrT07h.jpg","vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2021-04-29","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":2875316,"name":"Lindi","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":49,"season_number":1,"show_id":123348,"still_path":"/6DMhiPdWwTBlymJtOKvkgR3uR1G.jpg","vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":2,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2021-04-29","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":2875317,"name":"Rebecca","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":49,"season_number":1,"show_id":123348,"still_path":"/tsVtkPeY80xlctysFBbkhI8f2gs.jpg","vote_average":6,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2021-05-06","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":2875318,"name":"Can","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":49,"season_number":1,"show_id":123348,"still_path":"/fsRb7hos30zvvc2w5jpa5u5703I.jpg","vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2021-05-06","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"finale","id":2875319,"name":"Restart","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":47,"season_number":1,"show_id":123348,"still_path":"/bk0XWrHWD8xdJ05ManLdM3ca0X4.jpg","vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Miniseries","overview":"","id":190635,"poster_path":"/aq0Y8Qpbt5GGZAaaPddZFxnvC18.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":6.6}}}
