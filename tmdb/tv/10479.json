When Pittsburgh is shut down due to a strike, the WENN crew gets a real emergency on their hands with a woman arriving to see Dr. Talbot.  Which would be great except that Dr. Talbot is a character on one of their shows and Cora is about to have a baby.  Will the ambulance get there on time?  Or will all of Pittsburgh share in welcoming a new little miracle?","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":4,"show_id":10479,"still_path":"/oBVEbcpQK1A3WG5Ly8Atogt5SCA.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525802db19c29531db37cba8","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":12068,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rupert Holmes","original_name":"Rupert Holmes","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1998-07-31","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":428716,"name":"The Follies Of WENN","overview":"As if the Winthrop brothers haven't had enough of WENN.  Luke Winthrop pleads his case before Betty and Scott that his school is in dire need of one thousand dollars or it will be forced to close.  What to do?  Put on a burlesque show, of course.  Maple, Eugenia, and Betty get their own solo numbers, Hilary gets to hold an audience in the palm of her hand...or glove, and Scott and Jeff do a comedy routine.  Unfortunately, all this is taking place while certain residents of the Barbican Hotel for Women (Betty and Maple) are under scrutiny and if they're caught, they might lose their rooms.  The surprise twist at the end is worth being raided for.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":4,"show_id":10479,"still_path":"/pcGrgYLuRu8pKMNCqUhXVvn7WAj.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525802db19c29531db37cbdb","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44740,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Richard Shepard","original_name":"Richard Shepard","popularity":2.257,"profile_path":"/vfZZxZva7WE2CztK7yEglWghuP1.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525802db19c29531db37cba8","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":12068,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rupert Holmes","original_name":"Rupert Holmes","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1998-08-07","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"standard","id":428717,"name":"Pratfall","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":4,"show_id":10479,"still_path":"/dS3wlSbggw1zN8Q4EckGDx1cRh7.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525802db19c29531db37cba8","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":12068,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rupert Holmes","original_name":"Rupert Holmes","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525802de19c29531db37cf7f","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":87038,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joanna Kerns","original_name":"Joanna Kerns","popularity":7.927,"profile_path":"/sylr5y79WIP6h5Q089RJARsr4kZ.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1998-08-14","episode_number":9,"episode_type":"standard","id":428718,"name":"Work Shift","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":4,"show_id":10479,"still_path":"/sx5l0mCehkfDC7MVLtp0D3z1tDI.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525802db19c29531db37cba8","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":12068,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rupert Holmes","original_name":"Rupert Holmes","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1998-08-21","episode_number":10,"episode_type":"standard","id":428719,"name":"Past Tense, Future Imperfect","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":4,"show_id":10479,"still_path":"/nsF46sBjbNrg2GoOQz7CvsZ8j3V.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525802db19c29531db37cba8","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":12068,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rupert Holmes","original_name":"Rupert Holmes","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1998-08-28","episode_number":11,"episode_type":"standard","id":428720,"name":"The Sunset Also Rises","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":4,"show_id":10479,"still_path":"/vPOxVF3yfSw9nIgod4ehRm6QaKi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1998-09-04","episode_number":12,"episode_type":"standard","id":428721,"name":"At Cross Purposes","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":4,"show_id":10479,"still_path":"/vvKgV3760aVGTaehsEWmoVqe66R.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525802db19c29531db37cba8","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":12068,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rupert Holmes","original_name":"Rupert Holmes","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1998-09-11","episode_number":13,"episode_type":"finale","id":428722,"name":"All's Noisy on the Pittsburgh Front","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":4,"show_id":10479,"still_path":"/5uysm1oE6Y5LaEg0d2I9mYmNu1a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525802db19c29531db37cba8","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":12068,"known_for_department":"Sound","name":"Rupert Holmes","original_name":"Rupert Holmes","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 4","overview":"","id":20677,"poster_path":"/mkVHDBcOM4An2fkfmWj65q1bUkl.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0}}}
