When Amaya and Justin return from the hospital, Amaya confronts Teck, telling him how pissed she was at the other roomies for bailing on the Ruthie situation. Teck appreciates her honesty and gives her a hug. Matt brings Ruthie home from the hospital. She has no recollection of what happened to her. As the sun rises, Ruthie tells Matt and Amaya that nothing like that ever happened to her before--she thinks her drink must have been spiked. Amaya tells Ruthie that she just drank too much. There is much concern in the house for Ruthie's well-being. Ruthie says that this incident is a wake-up call, but there's no way she's going to 12-step it. She says, \"\"I'm not saying that I'm going to quit anything. I'm saying that I'm going to do it in moderation from now on.\"\"",

The Real World, MTV's long-running series which deals with the lives, romances and turmoil of seven completely strangers from different ethnic backgrounds and religion, has reached its 10th season. The show remains popular as it opens viewers (and the cast members) minds up by discussing issues about sex, rascism, suicide, birth control, homosexuality and religion. This special episode brings back most of the show's cast members from past seasons whose lives have been affected by the show's realism. Among the 49 returning are Ruthie (Hawaii), Syrus (Boston), Heather B. (New York) and Melissa (New Orleans). Hosted by MTV's John Norris, we look back on the greatest Real World moments followed by interviews from the cast members and special guests who have found the show inspirational.",

Her vibrant personality and free-spiritedness (that means she likes to walk around naked) has Theo in player mode from their first handshake. When Aneesa reveals that she's a lesbian, Theo is thrown an unexpected loop. But in his mind, the fact that she's not attracted to men seems only a minor hurdle and he continues to flirt shamelessly. \"\"We're going to be here for four months, anything can happen,\"\" he reasons.",

Aneesa, however, deciphers the clues and figures out the truth. Her understanding gives Chris a lot of comfort. Kyle also guesses that Chris is gay but only discusses it with Keri--he doesn't want to put Chris on the spot, especially with Theo in the house.\n\nWhile Theo is comfortable with Aneesa's lesbianism, he finds the idea of two men together disgusting. His constant comments about it anger Aneesa while Chris silently listens in. However, Aneesa has an interesting way of showing her unhappiness--instead of telling Theo how she feels, she gets in the shower with him and sleeps naked in bed with him. Despite all of the mixed signals, Theo apparently does understand their dynamic.",

There is also something else going on between Cara and Kyle and the new coupling seems to be adept at keeping Keri on the outside looking in.\n\nWhen it gets down to the wire and Keri's skit isn't where Cara wants it. She asks Keri if they can cut it. Keri, who seems to let things roll off her back with ease, agrees, although she thinks that it is going to have to happen anyway because their job requires them to do three. When Cara explains to Laura, their boss, that she wants to cut the skit, she claims that one of the major reasons is that Tonya is going into surgery.",

Desperate for help, Aneesa seeks refuge in Chris, who confesses his parents were appalled when he revealed his sexual orientation. With time, however, Chris's parents warmed up to their son's homosexuality, and learned to love and accept his lifestyle.\n\nHowever, Aneesa's problems go beyond her parents. She's torn between the two women she's been dating, Danielle and Latonia. On the one hand Danielle is physically attractive and outgoing, but Aneesa is fed up with her pretentiousness. On the other hand, Latonia is fun and down-to-earth, but doesn't interact well with Aneesa's personality. Aneesa fears the single life, and doesn't know if she can deal with an emotional breakup with either women.",

At the Tucks Ball McKenzie's drunken alter ego, Mary, shows up in army fatigues and she's got a penchant for beer and 40 year-old men in plumbers uniforms.\n\nLater, Knight questions Jemmye's feelings as they cuddle next to a photo of her and her towering, basketballer boyfriend, Kodi. Jemmye begins to question her own motivations with Knight, maybe he's turning into more than just friends with benefits. \"Team Knight or Team Kodi?\" That is the question!\n\nThe next night leads to even more confusion when Jemmye, who had been toying with the idea of going to see Kodi play basketball, sees Knight flirting with another random girl right next to her. As Knight sees it, Jemmye needs to go to Kodi's game so she can stop messing up his. On a happier romantic note, McKenzie gives Mary the night off when she meets Travis, a cute, spring-breaker who is more into talking that drinking.\n\nWith Knight exploring his options, Jemmye is left with the need to go to Kodi's game, so she and Ashlee venture to Baton Rouge, where they not only run into Kodi, but twenty of his closest family members. With somewhat of a shrug off from her baller boyfriend, Jemmye is more confused that ever as the roommates go into the final Mardi Gras celebration, Fat Tuesday.\n\nAt the bar, McKenzie runs into Travis and she learns that, like herself, he is a fellow blacker-outer. But while they might be a match made in foggy-memoried heaven, Travis has to return home, leaving McKenzie without a man but with a valuable lesson: if you blackout a lot, you might want to cut back on the drinking.\n\nFresh off her encounter with Kodi, and filled to the brim with Bourbon Street's finest booze, Jemmye confides in Knight that before Kodi she was in a long-term abusive relationship. As she opens up to Knight she begins to realize that she feels a deeper connection and safety with him that she has with any other man. As for Knight, the feeling might be mutual.",

After the show Sahar meets Theresa and hits it off with her, perhaps she will get the tutelage she needs after all.\n\nThe next day, Jemmey's mother, Alice, who affectionately refers to her daughter as \"The Little Slut Puppy,\" pays the roommates a visit. Knight, ever the classy gentleman, takes mother and daughter out on Bourbon Street for a romantic horse & carriage ride and, of course, a round of shots.\n\nRyan decides to get back at Preston one final time by calling the cops and explaining The Toothbrush Situation. The cops come to the house and interrupt the criminal Preston, who they find red-handed lying on the couch and reading. All the roommates hold back laughter as the cops ask Preston and Ryan to come down to the police station and give their statements.\n\nA heart to heart between mother and daughter reveals that Alice thinks Knight is good for Jemmye and that he can help break down her barriers and begin to trust men again. Meanwhile, on the other side of town Theresa invites Sahar over to jam.

Wanting to give back, McKenzie asks the roommates to help her build a house with Habitat for Humanity. All the roommates are eager to help... except for Ryan, a true giver, who thinks he'd be better suited helping the victims of Katrina by doing hair.\n\nWhen Sahar begins to feel the love pangs pulling at her heartstrings, she calls home to find out that Pablo hooked up with another girl. Being in an open relationship, they both enjoyed their right to hook up with other people, but with Pablo so far away and jealousy setting in, Sahar is beginning to rethink her decision.\n\nAfter a successful day working with Habitat for Humanity, the roommates go out to celebrate. Knight begins to see McKenzie in a different light, perhaps it's her bright, shining compassion, and thinks maybe she, not Jemmye, is the girl for him. But while McKenzie is willing to indulge Knight in some harmless flirting, she draws the line at that. With Knight putting the moves on McKenzie and McKenzie playing hard to get, Jemmye is left watching this all unfold before her eyes, and wonders that maybe Knight isn't the trustworthy, gentleman she once thought he was.\n\nWith Sahar boiling from the Pablo Situation and the McKenzie/Knight/Jemmye Triangle brewing, she tells Knight he's being disrespectful. Taking no prisoners, Knight immediately goes in for the kill and rubs salt in the Pablo-inflicted wound.\n\nThe next day, with Sahar still plotting his demise, Knight avoids the situation altogether by going to watch a hockey game with Preston. During their man-date, Preston opens up to Knight about the pressures he feels to be a man and how his sexuality sometimes get in the way. With his new found sensitivity, Knight returns to the house and apologizes to Sahar, who sets him straight on how he talks to people.\n\nWith Knight open to suggestion, the roommates urge Jemmye to talk to him about the way he talks to and treats her. But Jemmye can't help but feel a tinge of pain from the bruises of her past relationship, and would rather avoid the topic than confront it. When Jemmye decides to volunteer at a battered women's shelter she realizes that while her situation is over, she still hasn't dealt with it, and decides that she must confront Knight.",

As half the roommates spend the holiday helping others at the New Orleans Mission, Knight, Jemmye, Preston and McKenzie celebrate in the traditional style of drinking until they get lost, get in a fight with a telephone, cry, run away and black out. And boy do they! McKenzie accidentally strays from the pack, and is left wandering the streets of New Orleans. With some well-needed alone time, Knight and Jemmye continue to celebrate and have a relationship conversation ending in Knight deciding to have sex with other women, but Jemmye that night.\n\nBack at the Mission, Ryan has an eye-opening conversation with a twenty-one year-old homeless man, Carlos. Feeling the good deeds done, the roommates return to the house to get ready so they can join their friends. However, they're in for a surprise when they come home to find the house in shambles after Hurricane Jemmye stormed through, flipping over coffee tables and ripping the phone out of the wall.\n\nMeanwhile, McKenzie is still lost, but has found comfort in the arms of a sexy stranger, Grant, who promises to keep her safe, as long as she continue to hang out and drink with him. Looking to call it a night, McKenzie and Grant go back to Hell House. Upon finding the phone dismantled and no way to call a cab (because cell phones don't exist yet), McKenzie and Grant have nothing else to do but make out... all over the house. Now able to walk, Jemmye decides that she wants to go home, so she throws on some over-sized sweats, no shoes and heads east towards Mississippi. When Ashlee talks her off someone else's stoop, she brings Jemmye home and tucks her into bed.\n\nThe next morning, everyone is a little dazed, to say the least. Blackout Queen McKenzie and Emotional Wreck Jemmye go grocery shopping and talk about the issues that Jemmye is clearly not dealing with. After the night she had, Jemmye decides that she must confront her issues with domestic abuse and goes back to the battered women's shelter to talk to Dale, the social worker. Committed to getting past her issues with men, Dale and Jemmye decide to keep a weekly appointment. Back at the house, after never having confessed her abuse to her mother, Jemmye calls Alice and reveals her secret. Feeling a weight lifted off her shoulders, the roommates offer support to the newly changing Jemmye.",

As Ryan goes throughout the house offering the exotic delicacy to the roommates, his eccentric behavior seems to be bothering them more than usual. All he did was cook and eat a dead pet fish! Later that night, the roommates go out for some well-needed party time and we get to meet drunk Ryan, a fun-loving guy who only wants to hit his head into the car window and punch the back of a seat.\n\nBack at the house, while he beats his head into the headboard, Ryan confesses to Sahar that he has an extreme case of obsessive-compulsive disorder. She offers her support to him and things begin to look up for Ryan. That is until we see him creeping around the house in the middle of the night via night vision cameras. The next morning, Ashlee realizes that all her Percocet are missing. After giving one to Ryan, she asks him where he thinks they might be. Ryan gives a shrug and suggests that the former prescription pill junkie, Knight, might have something to do with their disappearance.\n\nAmidst rumors flying around the house about who stole the Percocet, Eric decides to perform standup comedy, his subject, the \"Peeing on the Toothbrush Incident.\" Too soon. As Sahar watches Eric perform, she begins to feel the stage pulling at the strings of her heart. Sahar invites some local musicians over the house to jam and decides to sing one of their songs at an upcoming open mic night. But after another playful conversation between Sahar and Knight turns heated, she finds herself questioning her singing ability.\n\nKnight, surrounded by rumors and once again caught in conflict with Sahar, goes to the sage Loretta of the New Orleans Mission for some advice. Loretta sets him straight and he goes back to the house, once again apologizes to Sahar and they are friends once again... sort of. To satisfy the roommates, but mostly himself, Knight takes a drug test and shows it to Ashlee. It tests negative for everything... too bad drug tests don't test for Percocet.\n\nWith the drug test out of the way and Knight seeming to be innocent, the roommates' eyes once again fall on Ryan, questioning why he feels he needs to lie and steal. Even Ryan's confidant, Sahar, doesn't know what to make of him. But all that must wait, because it's time for Sahar to get up on stage and prove her singing chops. The soul girl gets onstage with her band, all seems to be going well until there is a lull in the song where there shouldn't be and Sahar realizes she's forgotten the words. When she gets off the stage she's embarrassed, but her knight in shining armor, Eric comes to the rescue and pleases the crowd with some ill-fitting freestyle beats. Back at the house, Ryan continues to isolate himself and the roommates concern for his behavior grows.",

And as Jemmye and Knight act more \"coupley\" than ever, Ashlee decides it's time for wedding. For sober or for drunk, till liquor do them part! The roommates have fun planning Knight and Jemmye's faux wedding, but when the groom gets wind of the situation he wants nothing to do with it and Jemmye feels like she's been left at the altar. Continuously ragging on Jemmye, the Bridezilla decides enough is enough and storms in on Knight, cuddling with Preston no less, and gives him a few good knocks in the face. Knight's black and blue is something new and it seems like the abused has now become the abuser.\n\nAt The Mission, Loretta throws a curveball the roommates' way when she asks them to live as the homeless for one day. So the gang packs up their overnight sacks and head over to The Mission for their homeless sleepover. When Knight and Ashlee get bored of camping outside, they decide to run away and hit up a bar. But when Loretta catches them, they've got some answering to do.\n\nWith Sahar's boyfriend, Pablo, coming to visit the same weekend she's set to perform with a local band, Flow Tribe, she's got a full dance card. When Pablo comes to the house with two of his buddies we learn a few things about him that we didn't previously know, like his name is actually Elie, he has groomed eyebrows, wears adorned t-shirts, drinks like a fish and according to one of his bro-buddies, \"gets more ass than a toilet seat.\" But really, he can't be all that bad and he proves this to the roommates when he boys a bottle of vodka for the roommates to share over brunch, the morning of his girlfriends fated gig.\n\nAs the day goes on Pablo/Elie doesn't slow down one bit and continues to drink until he can barely walk, talk or remember which girl in the house he's supposed to be showing affection to... and that's still when it's light out. Sahar leaves Pablow/Elie in the hands of her trusty roommates as she goes to sound check and then to beautify herself for her big number. By the time she gets to the club her roommates and her boyfriend are waiting for her, but when she says hi to Pablo/Elie she realizes that he's been checked out of the building for quite some time. With her boyfriend a mess and apparently fascinated by McKenzie's hair, it's all too much for the Lebanese Sensation and she's brought to tears. But have no fear, her trusty sidekick and one-time tryst, Eric comes to her rescue and makes her feel all better in time for her big performance. Putting the drama of the weekend aside, Sahar gets onstage and kills it. After everything their relationship has been through Sahar wonders whether Pablo/Elie is really the right guy for her or if he's simply as two-sided as his name.",

The roommates head down to The Creole Creamery and cheer on Eric and Knight as they try to down 8 scoops of ice cream in one sitting. If only it weren't for Eric's weak stomach and Knight's lactose intolerance, they might have actually been able to pull it off.\n\nFor Eric, Knight and McKenzie, it's their last day at Habitat for Humanity and they celebrate putting the last coast of paint on the house and handing the keys to the happy owner. Back at the house, Pablo sends an apology to the roommates and Sahar in fruit basket form.
