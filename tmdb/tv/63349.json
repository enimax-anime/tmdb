Set in northern Wales during a time rife with rebellion and political upheaval, Wilkin must walk a tight rope between protecting his true identity while also serving a mysterious destiny.\n\nGuided by Annora, a mystical healer whose seeming omniscience keeps Wilkin under her sway; manipulated by Milus Corbett, a devious Chamberlain with grand political aspirations; and driven by a deepening connection with the Baroness Lady Love, Wilkin struggles to navigate political, emotional and supernal pitfalls in his quest to understand his greater purpose.","popularity":14.328,"poster_path":"/apnKjgxmc2NtyRuII0TSQzqCs5D.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2850,"logo_path":"/wLBnXtbPu2pESrTtB1hbp3MK9Px.png","name":"Imagine
