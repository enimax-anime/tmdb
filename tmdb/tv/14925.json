The show is an English-language adaptation of Télévision de Radio-Canada's show Les Hauts et les bas de Sophie Paquin.\n\nThe show was created by Richard Blaimert and its executive producer is Jocelyn Deschênes, the same creative team behind the original series. It was the CBC's second attempt in as many years to create an English adaptation of a successful series from its French sister network, following the less successful Rumours.\n\nIn February 2008, it was announced that the show had been bought by ABC Family, part of Disney-ABC Television Group in the United States. The network signed on for the first 13 episodes, as well as an option for the second season of the show.\n\nOn March 27, 2009, the series was cancelled by CBC due to poor ratings.","popularity":5.022,"poster_path":"/xm9l8TessNspBvubGVvAAOo55WE.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2008-01-09","episode_count":13,"id":26460,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/xB771Ejb1MOOCc5NhWBBJ4JL0Sm.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2008-10-01","episode_count":19,"id":26461,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/i4K21Vm7uOWSmULeQLlYBwjQWzJ.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.5,"vote_count":2,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258366c760ee36aaa942e20","air_date":"2008-01-09","episodes":[{"air_date":"2008-01-09","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":530693,"name":"The Tornado","overview":"Sophie Parker’s perfect world blows into a tornado when her boyfriend dumps her for her best friend then steals all her best clients with a competing talent agency.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":14925,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"5258366d760ee36aaa942e49","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":181247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyrone Benskin","original_name":"Tyrone Benskin","popularity":2.677,"profile_path":"/jJ4xLfwYsK2iDL1Ge8u2FvlKCb9.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2008-01-16","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":530696,"name":"Sophie Comes Home","overview":"Sophie comes home with her newborn boy and has to break the news to her control-freak mom and an ex-boyfriend with delusions of fatherhood.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":14925,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"5258366d760ee36aaa942e49","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":181247,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tyrone Benskin","original_name":"Tyrone Benskin","popularity":2.677,"profile_path":"/jJ4xLfwYsK2iDL1Ge8u2FvlKCb9.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2008-01-23","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":530697,"name":"Groove Thing","overview":"Rick's new talent agency is going great and he throws a launch party - the bad part - he invited Sophie.\n\nNow Sophie must face her ex-clients and her ex-boyfriend when she decides to attend.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":14925,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2008-01-30","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":530698,"name":"Birth Control","overview":"Sophie's talent agency is getting back on it's feet, and she's finally getting used to being a mother.
