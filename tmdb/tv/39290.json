Needing to fill a record-setting 900 tags this season and having never failed to tag-out, the King of the Swamp gambles on a wild new bait to keep his perfect streak intact. Ronnie enlists Ashley's help to finish his season by making her equal partners in their business. Jacob and Don split up to run lines and snipe at the same time. Porkchop surprises Leron with a secret weapon he's been saving for the last day.",
