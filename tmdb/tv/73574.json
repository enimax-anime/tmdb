Luckily the Vroomster doesn’t have a scratch on it. Xuli and Foz are impressed with the tulip fields. Kyan, Lars and Ubercorn join over comms – it reminds Kyan of a rainbow! They all plan to meet up at the Flower Parade later.\n\nMeanwhile Glitch is in a nearby barn, instructing the Grimbots to fetch more tulips for a giant float which looks just like Glitch! Xuli and Foz spot a Grimbot driving a harvester, which is tearing up tons of tulips and rush to the Vroomster to stop it. Xuli flies the Vroomster to the harvester and Foz jumps aboard. The Grimbot insists he has permission to cut all the flowers but Foz doesn’t believe it and tries to wrestle the steering wheel from the Grimbot.\n\nXuli heads to the barn and discovers Glitch, Tala and Johan the flower farmer happily assembling Glitch’s statue. It turns out Johan has given permission for Glitch and Tala to use the flowers to build their float – whoops! There isn't a Glitch after all and the Go Jetters have made a mistake.\n\nFoz spots a big button in the harvester. He leans in to push it, the Grimbot notices at the last second and tries to stop him but it's too late. Foz presses the button, and both Foz and the Grimbot are ejected from the harvester and fall into a mud pile – they're stuck fast! Xuli, Glitch and Tala have run out of the barn to see the driverless harvester coming straight towards them. Xuli calls up Click Ons for her and Tala – they use G.O shield to redirect the harvester to stop it crashing into the barn. It works – but now the harvester is on course to hit the greenhouses! Xuli and Tala turn to see Glitch appear from out of the Grimbler – he has his Grim Mag on, ready to save the day. But Glitch is pulled towards the metal harvester and Xuli is dragged with them too – Grimbles!\n\nFoz manages to free himself from the mud and flies the Vroomster to catch up with the harvester, Xuli and Glitch. After a few failed attempts Foz manages to nudge the harvester off course and away from the greenhouse; the workers are safe. But now the out of control machine is heading towards some Grimbots which are still stuck in the mud. Tala drives the float between the Grimbots and the harvester, ready to sacrifice her hard work to save her Uncle's precious Grimbots. Foz summons all his new found flying skills and manages to lift the harvester; freeing Xuli and Glitch and saving the flower float in the nick of time. With everyone saved they head to the flower parade where Foz puts his new-found driving skills to good use by driving Glitch and Tala’s beautiful float.",
