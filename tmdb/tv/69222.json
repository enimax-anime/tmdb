Did this socially engaged feminist who used her notoriety and her microphone to create women’s rights defense projects failed her life’s most important project? When she is presented with “Plan B”, a time-traveling company, Florence, who feels immensely guilty and responsible, takes it as an opportunity to start over and save her daughter. These time-travels will bring her to question her choices as a mother of two, her choices on her career and her relationship with the father, with whom she is separated. Is she accountable for her daughter’s unhappiness? How far is she willing to go to save her?",

What's especially painful is that she'll no longer see Justin, her ex's son to whom she's become deeply attached. On the job, she feels increasingly powerless in the face of the injustices she encounters daily. Her faith in her work is dwindling fast. Then during a routine intervention with a family in crisis, her life is turned upside down. Given the lack of proof, how could she and her partner have avoided the worst? With the power of Plan B, she'll do everything possible to alter the course of the drama unfolding between two civilians. Her journey brings her face to face with her own anger. Did she subconsciously choose this path to find out who she really is?",
