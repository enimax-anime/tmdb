On the show they play brothers who live together in a strange house with a variety of unusual rooms. The show premiered on Nick Jr. Australia in August 2006 and on Noggin US on 16 October 2006, with 13 episodes developed by the highly acclaimed Sesame Workshop. The Sesame Workshop logo used on this show can only be seen on Noggin.\n\nInitial views of The Upside Down Show were disappointing, as it failed to match the views of Play With Me Sesame and Caillou during the 2006-2007 season. The show's d√©but was criticized as being similar to Ernie and Bert.\n\nOn 27 December 2006, in a New York Post interview, Shane Dundas expressed doubts about the return of the show for a second season.\n\nOn 1 June 2007, the Umbilical Brothers announced on their website that Nickelodeon/Noggin USA were not interested in a third season of The Upside Down Show, despite its success. In 2007, the show won the Creative Craft Daytime Emmy Award for Main Title Design and a Parents' Choice Award Silver Honor for Television.","popularity":2.227,"poster_path":"/2xuziRtz7P0MZKBmDUOjJuNIXUt.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2006-10-16","episode_count":13,"id":20978,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2008-10-09","episode_count":2,"id":20979,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":9,"vote_count":3,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258058619c29531db3a572b","air_date":"2006-10-16","episodes":[{"air_date":"2006-10-16","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":433258,"name":"Movie Theater","overview":"Shane and David make a movie (directed by Puppet), then search for the movie theatre to watch it.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":10676,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2006-10-17","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":433260,"name":"Barbershop","overview":"After visiting The Very Hairy room, Shane is apprehensive about getting a hair cut.
