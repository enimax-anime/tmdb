The television program centers around the larger than life death metal band Dethklok, and often portrays dark and macabre content, including such subjects as violence, death, and the drawbacks of fame, with extremely hyperbolic black humor; which accounts for the cartoon's consistent TV-MA rating. The show can be seen as both a parody and celebration of heavy metal culture.\n\nThe music, written by guitarist/creator Brendon Small, is credited to the band, and is featured in most of the episodes. The animation is often carefully synced to the music, with the chord positions and fingering of the guitar parts shown in some detail.\n\nOne of the trademarks of the show is having the usual \"bleeps\" for extreme profanity replaced by pinch harmonics.","popularity":34.694,"poster_path":"/aPOjCtJJIC1rcnitWmJUjZStMdd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6760,"logo_path":"/h3syDHowNmk61FzlW2GPY0vJCFh.png","name":"Williams Street","origin_country":"US"},{"id":4152,"logo_path":"/mcVI379lknPUPOn80eCGGZMxr3k.png","name":"Titmouse","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2013-10-27","episode_count":82,"id":1980,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/dUR0X26tpxBvYRjp2udtW9JC5GS.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2006-08-06","episode_count":20,"id":1977,"name":"Season 1","overview":"The first season of the animated show Metalocalypse originally aired on Adult Swim from August 6, 2006 to December 17, 2006 with 20 episodes.
