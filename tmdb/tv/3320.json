It follows three anthropomorphic mice motorcyclists named Throttle, Modo, and Vinnie who escape a war on their home planet Mars before arriving to defend the Earth from the evil that destroyed their homeland and to one day return to Mars. The mice's signature weapons consist of a cestus and a laser, a bionic arm, and flares. Despite the frequent battles, no blood is shown, no firearms are used and many villains are monsters, aliens, and robots. These elements allowed the show to still be considered suitable for children.","popularity":16.488,"poster_path":"/gBnbkQ7t6Ctri0A4nKDYWqIVF3f.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2301,"logo_path":"/qdPhBEP8sjK3Eb3rKc94554gcZt.png","name":"Marvel Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":185277,"logo_path":null,"name":"New World Animation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1993-09-18","episode_count":13,"id":10298,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/zmQnJ2uJumT23NhWBQZK90bGwZH.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7},{"air_date":"1994-09-20","episode_count":39,"id":10299,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/il87CqF3vkHn2ya7ClshemPuzfw.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1995-09-23","episode_count":13,"id":10300,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/upuYC6HcDDsNRYWcAikk8LV8Pvg.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.48,"vote_count":51,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52574f7919c29531db0de92b","air_date":"1993-09-18","episodes":[{"air_date":"1993-09-18","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":245376,"name":"Rock and Ride!","overview":"Throttle, Modo and Vinnie...The Biker Mice from Mars...escape their planet as it it devastated by the fish faced plutarkians.
