It is an eight-episode mini-series adapted from Jonathan Mahler's best-selling book, Ladies and Gentlemen, The Bronx Is Burning. The book focuses on baseball's triumph over the turmoil and hysteria of 1977 New York City and how the New York Yankees came to embody the hopes and fears of an unforgettable summer with Billy Martin and Reggie Jackson's warfare under George Steinbrenner's leadership.\n\nThe show stars Daniel Sunjata, Oliver Platt, and John Turturro. The 2007 debut of the series marks the 30th anniversary of the 1977 World Series win for the Yankees, the first under Steinbrenner.","popularity":2.455,"poster_path":"/dSHnNmmRVpcMBQ0DbWGErAvQ5SL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":2184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Tollin/Robbins Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":64946,"logo_path":null,"name":"ESPN Original Entertainment","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2007-07-08","episode_count":17,"id":15619,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2007-07-09","episode_count":8,"id":15618,"name":"Mini-Series","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":5,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5257816d19c29531db2673e9","air_date":"2007-07-09","episodes":[{"air_date":"2007-07-09","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":363187,"name":"The Straw","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":360,"season_number":1,"show_id":5560,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2007-07-17","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":363193,"name":"Team in Turmoil","overview":"Billy and George have a meeting to try and smooth things over before the beginning of the 1977 season.
