The ones who are suspected to have poisoned him are one of the two girls he is dating, and Sonoko who becomes the prime suspect when poison is found on her glove. Conan tranquilizes her and reveals the culprit to be the captain of the tennis team, Fumihiro Azuma. Conan explains Azuma high-fived Goutou with a poisoned glove and poisoned his hand; thus explaining why poison was found from Goutou's drink, towel, and Sonoko's glove. As a result, Goutou ingested the poison when he licked his fingers while changing the grip to his racquet. As evidence, Azuma's glove was found hidden in a tennis ball and poison was confirmed to be on it. Azuma confesses explaining Goutou injured him purposely to usurp his position in the competition and consequently made him lose his sponsors and scholarship.",

As evidence, Yuchi's book reveals it had been sandpapered to clean off Miku's blood.

At her funeral, Kaoru's brother accused her boyfriend Tsuge of pushing her down the stairs. In present day, Kogoro is summoned by Tsuge with the message, \"Come and I'll tell you about her murderer\". Kaoru's brother, her best friend Kazumi, and Tsuge's manager all show up at the same time. They find Tsuge bludgeoned to death in his workshop. Sleeping Kogoro explains that Tsuge was about to reveal Kazumi as the murderer through his shadow art. Kazumi, in love with Tsuge, killed Kaoru in hopes of being with him. She believed he was going to announce their relationship when she was summoned, but he instead told her to turn herself in. Blinded by rage, she kills him, but can't bring herself to destroy the incriminating sculpture as it was the only proof that Tsuge spent the last 3 months thinking about her.",

The woman says something to Scar Akai as he passes which startles him. But before he can follow her, Masumi confronts him and asks, \"Who are you?\" Scar Akai smiles and tells Masumi, \"you haven't changed a bit.\" and he reveals his face to her. Masumi, surprised and confused, responds with \"Shu-nii\". (nii is Japanese suffix to call an older brother). She questions Scar Akai, stating that she heard that Shuichi had died. Masumi and Scar Akai's confrontation ends abruptly when Scar Akai knocks Masumi unconscious with a taser.",

During the interrogation, Himuro provokes Kogoro into attacking him, knowing that Kogoro gave him an alibi for the time Numao fell. Kogoro accuses Himuro of killing Numao, but since there is no evidence at all and Kogoro himself gives an alibi to Himuro, Himuro is let go.",

As it takes on average 5-6 minutes for an ambulance in Tokyo to reach the site of an emergency, Conan asks when the call was made, and learns at about 2:10, right after the man hit the pavement. 10 minutes is a long time for someone to drop five floors, though. In the office of the loan shark signs of a struggle are found, and traces of someone who has been dragged from the balcony into the office. Also, there is a driver's license issued to Ryouhei Honda, and his glasses are found on the balcony outside of the railing.",

He denies involvement but the similarities in the previous cases are too great to ignore. After finding unusual clues, Conan puts Kogoro to sleep to reveal that Mizuki killed Yoko. Mizuki was attacked by the Hooded Man but saw it as an opportunity to frame him for Yoko’s murder. As evidence, Mizuki has been followed by Ran for the majority of the time; she didn‘t have time to dispose of the clothes and weapon used in the crime, meaning she is still in possession of them. Mizuki confesses that Yoko took everything, including her boyfriend, from her.",
