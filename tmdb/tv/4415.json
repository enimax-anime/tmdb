Brothers Keenen and Damon Wayans created, wrote and starred in the program. The show was produced by Ivory Way Productions in association with 20th Century Fox Television and was taped before a live studio audience at stage 7 at the Fox Television Center on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood, California. The title of the series was inspired by the NBC announcement of broadcasts being presented \"in living color\" during the 1950s and 1960s, prior to mainstream color television. It also refers to the fact that most of the show's cast were black, unlike other sketch comedy shows such as Saturday Night Live whose casts are usually mostly white.\n\nOther members of the Wayans family—Kim, Shawn and Marlon—had regular roles, while brother Dwayne frequently appeared as an extra. The show also starred the previously unknown actor/comedians Jim Carrey, Jamie Foxx, and David Alan Grier. Additionally, actress Rosie Perez, Dancing with the Stars judge and choreographer Carrie Ann Inaba and dancer Jennifer Lopez were members of the show's dance troupe The Fly Girls. The series won the Emmy for Outstanding Variety, Music or Comedy Series in 1990.","popularity":21.902,"poster_path":"/zW0mrEhzycyAsqrkOAH4m669ij2.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5441,"logo_path":null,"name":"Ivory Way Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":1556,"logo_path":"/31h94rG9hzjprXoYNy3L1ErUya2.png","name":"20th Century Fox Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":6,"id":13180,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1990-04-15","episode_count":13,"id":13177,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/wu18UTIh9rSYpjoyRmXzuZGfOUA.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1990-09-23","episode_count":26,"id":13179,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/98xDoaJpThkjxsIqWydi4JEYz3B.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":4},{"air_date":"1991-09-22","episode_count":30,"id":13178,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/2cuJ4wYfFVjnWzh1vJGA7CzbtYK.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1992-09-27","episode_count":32,"id":13175,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/oQ0AA8gXpB2narvRRRNv1Bvfru9.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1993-09-16","episode_count":26,"id":13176,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/kr276aYNb76wj14MJeQ17r7AKUu.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.442,"vote_count":95,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5257686c760ee36aaa3a8d57","air_date":"1990-04-15","episodes":[{"air_date":"1990-04-15","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":307419,"name":"Pilot","overview":"\"Love Connection\" host Chuck Woolery questions Robin Givens about her date with Mike Tyson; Redd Foxx gives tax tips.
