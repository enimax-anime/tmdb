The expected budget for repairs quickly doubles and Geri has to take over management of the build herself - but then the true impact of trying to undo more than 200 years of amateur construction hits home.",

A flood in 1968 led to the church's eventual deconsecration and it is just one of many churches in Britain that has been declared redundant. Decline in church-going and amalgamation of parishes have put a huge swathe of our architectural heritage in peril. Working their way up the property ladder, newly-weds Paul and Laura spotted the church in 2007 and decided this was the family home for them. They purchased the listed church with plans to turn it into a three-bedroom home. As the church is transformed, its past emerges - the dark times which marked its end and its links to an architectural movement that would change style forever, connecting it to the design of some of the greatest buildings in the country.",

But this ruin was at the heart of a revolution that saved our grandparents' generation and changed society forever. Its remarkable past doesn't stop there, it was slap bang in the heyday of architectural design and played a crucial role in the dark, dismal years of the 1930s depression. For new owners Nick and Brigitte, the rotting bunker offered the ideal space for them and their five-year-old twins. Their plan is ambitious - turn the concrete carcass into a carbon efficient home for life. When the couple first bought the pumping station, they had no sentimental attachment to its former life.

The Grade II listed property is full of history, but beset by damp, woodworm and death watch beetle. It is an overwhelming project to take on and yet new owners, Polly and Erich, are determined to turn this crumbling property into their dream home. As work gets under way, expensive and unforeseen structural problems are uncovered. Meanwhile, the historical and architectural investigations start to yield results. A leading expert thinks he has identified the original church location of the stained glass windows which firmly dates them to Henry VIII's Reformation. As Polly and Erich think they have sorted out the major problems, disaster strikes again. The Old Manor is broken into and badly vandalised.",

They start in the vestry to the rear, which they hope to transform into a spacious three double bedroom modern home. The plan was to then get a mortgage to complete the whole chapel, but the enormity of the task and the consequence of their tiny budget soon hits home. Simply digging foundations is a gruelling task as, rather than hiring a digger, they opt for doing it by hand to save their tiny budget.
