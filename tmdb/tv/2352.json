Maxwell keeps hiding her pregnancy tests to avoid further sadness, and even invites Fran and her relatives to join him on his special appearance on the Hollywood Squares. Val, Sylvia and Yetta advise Fran to go see a herbalist to help Maxwell's swimmers. At the herbal store, Fran buys a special shake that will help Maxwell's little swimmers swim faster and some special cookies that will make them hot for each other. The shake doesn't help, so Dr. Reynolds prescribes hormones for Fran, who also buys an ovulation kit. Her timing couldn't be worse when she starts ovulating right when Maxwell is up on the squares. But nothing that Whoopi Goldberg's dressing room can't fix. Meanwhile, C.C. and Niles accidentally eat the special cookies and feel hot for each other, and Val quits her brightness pills because it was making her too
