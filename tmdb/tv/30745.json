Any time... I just love it.\"\n\nStefania adds: \"We're Italian! Of course, we love our food. I enjoy seeing people's expressions when they taste the food I've made. It makes me happy.\"\n\nThe women are so close they're more like sisters. \"We're very alike,\" Daniela, 43, says. \"We like the same things. Stefania is fun to be with; everyone who meets her likes her.\"\n\nStefania, 41, is equally as kind about her cousin adding, \"Daniela's a beautiful person inside and out.\"\n\nThe Perth duo get along so well they're worried it may pose a problem for them during the competition. \"We muck around too much,\" Daniela says. \"We find it hard to be serious.\"",
