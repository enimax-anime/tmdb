From there, Sam turns his attention to pioneering nu metal artists like Korn and Deftones, who produced the kind of cathartic, anti-authority anthems that found affinity with thousands of seething, repressed suburban kids. Through their own brand of heavy, groove-oriented, but brazenly hip-hop-influenced sounds, these bands managed to achieve both popularity and credibility within the metal community.

Since then, the genre has exploded with creativity, spawning mind-bending, genre-defying acts and Ep 11 looks at the extreme musicianship of these bands, as well as their often extreme literary prowess and conceptual strength.","production_code":"","runtime":41,"season_number":1,"show_id":42277,"still_path":"/1rVX6M7AUkKtm4OsEjghaV9M2JW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-04-15","episode_number":12,"episode_type":"finale","id":1949528,"name":"Extreme Metal: The Lost Episode","overview":"Produced after the original series aired, this episode covers Florida Death Metal, Norwegian Black Metal, Grindcore, and other extreme subgenres.
