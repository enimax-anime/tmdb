them safe. He winds up falling into a hole that suddenly opens up. When the rest of the group search for him, they also fall into the hole, which turns out to be a whirlpool. It sucks them all under the water, and they emerge in a lake. They quickly find out that in this part of the plateau, the dominant species are lizard-like men, descendents of dinosaurs, and the humans are subservient to them. There is an ancient Roman structure to this civilization, including gladiator-type battles. While Marguerite and Veronica are forced to change into silky gowns for the entertainment of Tribune, the lizard-people's leader, Roxton is chosen to fight another human prisoner. The slaves and travelers rebel, and overthrow the lizard-men's intolerable rule, but not without loss ~ Roxton's opponent's sister ~ a rebel leade","production_code":"","runtime":44,"season_number":1,"show_id":896,"still_path":"/dQ6ErLQUTvBVz0ur0LaC5BPBQG9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5969eabe92514136a800d850","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":164599,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Budds","original_name":"Colin Budds","popularity":1.024,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5969eaca92514136a800d859","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1222913,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Thorpe","original_name":"James Thorpe","popularity":1.57,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5f3854085c071b0032ac026e","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71192,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greg Coote","original_name":"Greg Coote","popularity":0.652,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5f3ff4ac3bd26e00347e3bc3","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":172329,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeffrey M.

Summerlee are out gathering fruit and floral specimens when they are attacked by a huge bee, one the size of a man. Summerlee is stung, and it leaves him near death. The only cure is the nectar in the heart of the hive. Veronica, Malone and Roxton travel to the hive, leaving Challenger and Marguerite behind at the treehouse to care for Summerlee. Summerlee is delirious with fever, and imagines Marguerite is his long-dead wife. She plays along, to sooth him. In the meantime, Veronica, Malone and Roxton do make it to the hive, work their way deep into it, gather nectar, and head back quickly to the treehouse, just in time to save Summerlee's life.","production_code":"","runtime":44,"season_number":1,"show_id":896,"still_path":"/3pLy3C0qI1HLleYiTVJSE34Ukod.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5969eabe92514136a800d850","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":164599,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Colin Budds","original_name":"Colin Budds","popularity":1.024,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5969eadfc3a3683b6100d62f","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1851712,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Durnford King","original_name":"Durnford King","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5f3854085c071b0032ac026e","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71192,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greg Coote","original_name":"Greg Coote","popularity":0.652,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5f3ff4ac3bd26e00347e3bc3","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":172329,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeffrey M.

They are attacked by warriors in black and white paint who capture Challenger. That night the group sneaks into the warriors' village...to find Challenger sitting quietly and drinking tea with a beautiful blonde woman named Cassandra. She and her husband had been part of an early expedition, also stranded and found by the warriors tribe twelve years ago; they were soon made king and queen there. She tells our group that going onto the burial grounds was considered taboo, and for this Challenger would have to remain captive for life. The only way they can save him is by going to the Cave of Fear and retrieving her husband's bones for burial. They set off, but soon discover why the cave is avoided ~ it's walls are covered in a hallucinogenic fungus, wtih a really nasty additional effect. It drives those affected to suicide - which Cassandra apparently knew when","production_code":"","runtime":44,"season_number":1,"show_id":896,"still_path":"/cNWpW7IjjgpL47cPh7qxI2q3kWB.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"52540c2d19c29579403006c1","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1221012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Millar","original_name":"Catherine Millar","popularity":1.614,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5969eaeec3a3683b4200d003","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":44137,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alison Lea Bingeman","original_name":"Alison Lea Bingeman","popularity":0.753,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5f3854085c071b0032ac026e","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71192,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greg Coote","original_name":"Greg Coote","popularity":0.652,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5f3ff4ac3bd26e00347e3bc3","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":172329,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeffrey M.

Marguerite, all the while, has been gathering gleaming gemstones in her backpack. At least she will not go back empty handed. A fog begins to fill the air around them...dense...deep fog. From out of the mist forms take shape: cloaked figures and eerie rock formations, encircling a stone slab. They find themselves surrounded by Druid-like figures who swarm over Marguerite. Roxton tries desperately to protect her, but she is torn from his grasp. The two men are restrained and Marguerite is carried away and deposited on the stone slab. It turns out that Marguerite figures in an ancient prophecy and that her fate has finally caught up with her, here. What it means, she must discover for herself, but it involves retrieving a sacred jemstone. She, along with Roxton and Malone, must go through several obstacles like headhunters and a leap of faith to accomplish Marguer","production_code":"","runtime":44,"season_number":1,"show_id":896,"still_path":"/7uaQctLVEqEJDbyjp5urHhkzPL4.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"52540c2d19c29579403006c1","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1221012,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Catherine Millar","original_name":"Catherine Millar","popularity":1.614,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5969eb1a925141382c0019e2","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1196973,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Guy Mullally","original_name":"Guy Mullally","popularity":2.317,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5f3854085c071b0032ac026e","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71192,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greg Coote","original_name":"Greg Coote","popularity":0.652,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5f3ff4ac3bd26e00347e3bc3","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":172329,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Jeffrey M.

There is nowhere to run or hide, except in what looks like an overgrown cave opening. They dash into it only to discover it is man-made, an old, crumbling mine shaft. There's a loud rumbling that leads to a cave-in. Veronica escapes, but the others are trapped inside. Near death from suffocation, they are saved by Garza, part of a group banished to the mine by a plague-like disease, and led by a blind little boy known as The Oracle. The boy decrees our group must remain underground forever, and is unswayed even by Challenger's discovery that the tremors are caused by a sleeping volcano waking up around them. On the outside, Veronica manages to get Roxton and Summerlee from the treehouse, but they meet up with the Vantu again, who are not easily persuaded to let them rescue the others from their mountain prison.","production_code":"","runtime":44,"season_number":1,"show_id":896,"still_path":"/pJFyA8jlJX7G2vHcdWYs363zWrz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52540c2e19c2957940300783","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46891,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gilbert M.

At the same time, Veronica appears on the Plateau, and in a shocking confrontation with Captain Askwith, realizes she has her own mission to complete: pursue Askwith and somehow return him to his ship.","production_code":"","runtime":44,"season_number":3,"show_id":896,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52540c3419c2957940300947","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":35276,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Garfield Reeves-Stevens","original_name":"Garfield Reeves-Stevens","popularity":1.153,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52540c3419c295794030092d","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":35278,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Judith Reeves-Stevens","original_name":"Judith Reeves-Stevens","popularity":2.101,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"596a019b9251417987006a36","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":141989,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Michael Pattinson","original_name":"Michael Pattinson","popularity":2.008,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Ned Malone / Johnny Ringo","credit_id":"52540c3b19c2957940300e53","order":4,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1221020,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Orth","original_name":"David Orth","popularity":5.793,"profile_path":"/7jblOrBIxFu5u4qyzn0jAQkT2yS.jpg"},{"character":"Veronica Layton","credit_id":"52540c3919c2957940300dd1","order":5,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":29479,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jennifer O'Dell","original_name":"Jennifer O'Dell","popularity":6.824,"profile_path":"/fQ3nLCHfxj5hVsYQWSEA1ZeVzo7.jpg"},{"character":"Lord Winston Churchill","credit_id":"5f384ac38813e400385a9f7d","order":505,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":75258,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Linal Haft","original_name":"Linal Haft","popularity":3.749,"profile_path":"/eYgjk7JR75F1hV7OA7LSZUN4ZKw.jpg"},{"character":"Captain Marchbanks","credit_id":"5f384aecefcea900349d40b7","order":506,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1673348,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jared Robinsen","original_name":"Jared Robinsen","popularity":2.572,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Captain Mark Askwith","credit_id":"5f384aa58813e40036584409","order":677,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61905,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Steven Vidler","original_name":"Steven Vidler","popularity":4.712,"profile_path":"/1rpOAasgY5DEpVur3SjumIkyQ7S.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2001-10-27","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":49118,"name":"The Travelers","overview":"While searching for the missing Malone, Marguerite is saved from a cannibal attack by a dashing trio of bandits.
