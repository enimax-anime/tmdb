Meanwhile, Officer Janette Fernandez must put both her investigative talent and her patience to the test when she comes across three commercial lobstermen who have caught more lobster than they are allowed by law. However, it's not the violation that gets her fuming, it's the violators themselves.\n\nIt's a busy day for Officer Fernandez when later she finds herself called to one of the unfortunate byproducts of 'lobster fever', becoming part of a team of law enforcement agencies trying to locate a missing scuba diver.",

Down on the shores of the Florida Keys, Officer Izsak races her 26-foot vessel to rescue a stranded couple from the ocean... and each other.\n\nLater, Officer Erik Steinmetz's routine boat patrol leads him to an unexpected emergency when he comes across a sick loggerhead sea turtle floating in the middle of the ocean. He races to shore through some of the most dangerous channels and shallows the Keys have to offer in order to get this endangered species some much-needed medical attention.\n\nOperation Wild: about the show",
