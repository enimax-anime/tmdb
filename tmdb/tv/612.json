The show focused on two lifelong friends, Sanford and Del, and their adventures at the fictional Barder College. With the exception of their roommate Joe, nearly everyone at Barder is stupid and inept. Nonetheless, the idiotic, irresponsible, and thoughtless Sanford and Del are portrayed as the series' heroes, whereas the responsible, intelligent Joe is the de facto villain in most episodes.\n\nThe series was created by Family Guy veteran writers Mark Hentemann and Steve Callaghan, based on a short film they had created years earlier. It is to-date the only animated series produced for MTV by Warner Bros. Animation.\n\nThe show's theme song is The Flaming Lips' song \"Fight Test\" from the album Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots.","popularity":4.264,"poster_path":"/qnncqkrLZuPenQTBbpvoSKEOVNi.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":6042,"logo_path":null,"name":"MTV Animation","origin_country":"US"},{"id":2785,"logo_path":"/l5zW8jjmQOCx2dFmvnmbYmqoBmL.png","name":"Warner Bros.
