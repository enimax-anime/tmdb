The series is considered to be the fourth generation of the My Little Pony franchise, following earlier lines and television show tie-ins in the 1980s and 1990s. The series premiered on October 10, 2010, on The Hub, an American pay television channel partly owned by Hasbro.\n\nThe show follows a studious unicorn pony named Twilight Sparkle as her mentor Princess Celestia guides her to learn about friendship in the town of Ponyville. Twilight becomes close friends with five other ponies: Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie. Each represents a different face of friendship, and Twilight discovers herself to be a key part of the magical artifacts, the \"Elements of Harmony\". The ponies share adventures and help out other residents of Ponyville, while working out the troublesome moments in their own friendships.\n\nHasbro selected animator Lauren Faust as the creative director and executive producer for the show. Faust sought to challenge the established \"girly\" nature of the existing My Little Pony line, creating more in-depth characters and adventurous settings, incorporating Hasbro's suggestions for E/I content and marketing of the toy line.","id":44632,"poster_path":"/jiiDHvOpz7t8Ns2xa7qYFG0LcuP.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":8.6},"2":{"_id":"5258a94d760ee346616d4f1c","air_date":"2011-09-17","episodes":[{"air_date":"2011-09-17","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":778703,"name":"The Return of Harmony (1)","overview":"The peace of Equestria is threatened when Discord, a mischievous spirit of disharmony, escapes from his imprisonment in stone.

Season 2 of the series premiered on September 17, 2011, on Hub Network, an American pay television channel partly owned by Hasbro.\n\nThe show follows a studious unicorn pony named Twilight Sparkle as her mentor Princess Celestia guides her to learn about friendship in the town of Ponyville. Twilight becomes close friends with five other ponies: Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie. Each represents a different face of friendship, and Twilight discovers herself to be a key part of the magical artifacts, the \"Elements of Harmony\". The ponies share adventures and help out other residents of Ponyville, while working out the troublesome moments in their own friendships.\n\nHasbro selected animator Lauren Faust as the creative director and executive producer for the show. Faust sought to challenge the established \"girly\" nature of the existing My Little Pony line, creating more in-depth characters and adventurous settings, incorporating Hasbro's suggestions for marketing of the toy line.","id":44633,"poster_path":"/iNG058odrsQILzJssgecwgbBVlU.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":8.2},"3":{"_id":"5258a94d760ee346616d4f38","air_date":"2012-11-10","episodes":[{"air_date":"2012-11-10","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":778741,"name":"The Crystal Empire (1)","overview":"Northern Equestria's Crystal Empire has reappeared after being afflicted with a curse that made it vanish for 1,000 years.

developed by Lauren Faust, originally aired on The Hub in the United States. The series is considered to be the fourth generation of the My Little Pony franchise, following earlier lines and television show tie-ins in the 1980s and 1990s. Season 4 of the series premiered on November 23, 2013, on The Hub, an American pay television channel partly owned by Hasbro.\n\nThe show follows a studious unicorn pony named Twilight Sparkle as her mentor Princess Celestia guides her to learn about friendship in the town of Ponyville. Twilight becomes close friends with five other ponies: Applejack, Rarity, Fluttershy, Rainbow Dash, and Pinkie Pie. Each represents a different face of friendship, and Twilight discovers herself to be a key part of the magical artifacts, the \"Elements of Harmony\". The ponies share adventures and help out other residents of Ponyville, while working out the troublesome moments in their own friendships.\n\nHasbro selected animator Lauren Faust as the creative director and executive producer for the show. Faust sought to challenge the established \"girly\" nature of the existing My Little Pony line, creating more in-depth characters and adventurous settings, incorporating Hasbro's suggestions for marketing of the toy line.","id":44636,"poster_path":"/erxqAQsiUMtfuz7K4wq4iDbVIUm.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":8.3},"5":{"_id":"552012a69251414a5a001821","air_date":"2015-04-04","episodes":[{"air_date":"2015-04-04","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1050976,"name":"The Cutie Map (1)","overview":"The Mane 6 are summoned to solve a friendship problem only to find a utopian village where everyone has given up their Cutie Marks.","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":5,"show_id":33765,"still_path":"/i2VD1oAJIXW8ygfoGwxGEhmadIz.jpg","vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"crew":[{"job":"Story","department":"Writing","credit_id":"61e425dc2d9375008a25153e","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1183757,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Meghan McCarthy","original_name":"Meghan McCarthy","popularity":0.84,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Teleplay","department":"Writing","credit_id":"61e425e9cae632006aa021d6","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3385136,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Scott Sonneborn","original_name":"Scott Sonneborn","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Teleplay","department":"Writing","credit_id":"61e425f67d2bc1009fcca927","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2118384,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"M.A. Larson","original_name":"M.A. Larson","popularity":1.459,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Starlight Glimmer (voice)","credit_id":"63e9256a9512e1008cb7b033","order":567,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":74358,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kelly Sheridan","original_name":"Kelly Sheridan","popularity":7.188,"profile_path":"/sxg2oRxwAEWd2Y8baJarjwC1XPA.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2015-04-04","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1051129,"name":"The Cutie Map (2)","overview":"The Mane 6 have had their Cutie Marks taken and must find a way to get them back.
