It chronicles the lives of six stylists who work at salons located in Green Brook Township, New Jersey. The Gatsby Salon, where the series is based upon, relaunched with a multimillion dollar renovation and began hiring new employees in 2009, which included two of the main cast members: Tracy DiMarco and Olivia Blois Sharpe. Reruns of the series also air on Bravo.\n\nThe series was scheduled to return for its sixth season on October 6, 2013. However, it was announced that the Esquire Network will be taking over the Style Network rather than G4 as originally planned. Currently, it is unknown if the series will launch on Esquire or one of Style's sister NBCUniversal Cable networks, such as E!, Bravo or Oxygen. Season 6 encompasses Olivia Blois Sharpe and Michelle DeCarlo as they pack their things and rent a summer house in Asbury Park, New Jersey. Tracy's wedding will also be included.","popularity":3.696,"poster_path":"/ijUXDBo01tugHrnC8Oei0HjKYdB.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2012-04-22","episode_count":4,"id":44790,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2010-03-21","episode_count":8,"id":44786,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/1Ya1UmkfakiE72ResyQjSfEiVQu.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2010-09-05","episode_count":23,"id":44787,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/26D7xYObsjYeUwCTLl0dHrEe31g.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2011-05-15","episode_count":23,"id":44788,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/8GVUkyxarLv96a12JkWupZe6y6Z.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2012-02-19","episode_count":23,"id":44789,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2013-01-28","episode_count":17,"id":44791,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":5,"vote_average":8}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258aa7d760ee346616e4153","air_date":"2010-03-21","episodes":[{"air_date":"2010-03-21","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":780282,"name":"Jersey Style Invasion","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":33984,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-03-28","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":780283,"name":"Pain is Beauty","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":33984,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-04-04","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":780284,"name":"Jersey Video Vixen","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":33984,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-04-11","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":780285,"name":"Jersey Girl Brawl","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":33984,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-04-18","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":780286,"name":"I Don't Wanna Lose My Nails","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":33984,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-04-25","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":780287,"name":"What Would Alexa Date?","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":33984,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-05-02","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":780288,"name":"Getting Sauced in Jersey","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":33984,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-05-09","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"finale","id":780289,"name":"Cover Catastrophe","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":33984,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":44786,"poster_path":"/1Ya1UmkfakiE72ResyQjSfEiVQu.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},"2":{"_id":"5258aa7d760ee346616e4167","air_date":"2010-09-05","episodes":[{"air_date":"2010-09-05","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":780290,"name":"Bronzer, Babies and Break-ups","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":33984,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-09-12","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":780291,"name":"Jersey Boss","overview":"With maternity leave on the horizon Christy wants to identify her replacement as early as possible.
