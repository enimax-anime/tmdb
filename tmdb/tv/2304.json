It is based on The Railway Series of books by the Reverend Wilbert Awdry and his son, Christopher Awdry. These books deal with the adventures of a group of anthropomorphised locomotives and road vehicles who live on the fictional Island of Sodor. The books were based on stories Wilbert told to entertain his son, Christopher during his recovery from measles. From Series one to four, many of the stories are based on events from Awdry's personal experience.",

To try and still make it, Toby asks the other engines if they are able to help him out at all, but they are simply much too busy for the poor little Tram Engine. But with great luck for Toby, choppy seas delay one of the special deliveries till the next day, which means Toby will now make it to the farm, or so he thinks.",
