Sidney comes to the rescue and is able to save Edith before it's too late and he also tells Archie that he knew about her illness before and so did Edith. Sidney mentions that he did tell Edith to stay off her feet, but obviously, with the cooking for Archie, she didn't listen to his instruction.    Archie visits Edith upstairs and is disappointed that she didn't get rest instead of doing something for his party. Instead of leaving to host it, Archie falls asleep in the arms of his lover, Edith.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"1979-04-08","episode_number":27,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":9,"show_id":1922,"still_path":"/ymm0zGdpvEPhmEkIqgFkOqRZJro.jpg"},"name":"All in the Family","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":16,"logo_path":"/wju8KhOUsR5y4bH9p3Jc50hhaLO.png","name":"CBS","origin_country":"US"}],"number_of_episodes":210,"number_of_seasons":9,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"All in the Family","overview":"Archie Bunker, a working class bigot, constantly squabbles with his family over the important issues of the day.","popularity":33.913,"poster_path":"/s2Y9QWyuyjRP78DZsatknEjn0iN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59051,"logo_path":null,"name":"Viacom Enterprises","origin_country":""},{"id":14982,"logo_path":"/cGOwFUn8Ffvo9JKfpsElS2nxPmk.png","name":"Tandem Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":176162,"logo_path":"/9MV8uhnIimEwcu9gDyjeOOnfzVz.png","name":"American Broadcasting Company (ABC)","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1991-02-16","episode_count":6,"id":5572,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1971-01-12","episode_count":13,"id":5564,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/t91zLQxskdfF6gzppijtyacakWs.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":2.8},{"air_date":"1971-09-18","episode_count":24,"id":5563,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/7Xd9NibzJC0qAhRBFTftQUEuqHD.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":7.5},{"air_date":"1972-09-16","episode_count":24,"id":5566,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/sikcQvrLzf6Cc84aT9F5HL5OfuN.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":5},{"air_date":"1973-09-15","episode_count":24,"id":5565,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/86925zFXDmElM3jXSG8ojQKnG3o.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1974-09-14","episode_count":25,"id":5568,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/pMcs1mwiWEJCuRNvaEY7mmnWPo0.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1975-09-08","episode_count":24,"id":5567,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":"/aSG2DIQnR9EDirPFjS0Tzzu9Of6.jpg","season_number":6,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1976-09-22","episode_count":25,"id":5570,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":"/1dog9LjjQqn82gunwFjezyAnNqA.jpg","season_number":7,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1977-10-02","episode_count":24,"id":5571,"name":"Season 8","overview":"","poster_path":"/dLWzMC1Z5jFBGoMZ8Kc3mn1qRW6.jpg","season_number":8,"vote_average":1},{"air_date":"1978-09-24","episode_count":27,"id":5569,"name":"Season 9","overview":"","poster_path":"/uKstPXySknK2Hzojw3iz6I6h580.jpg","season_number":9,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"Like the Good Book says, \"Let him who is without sin... be the rollin' stone.\"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":141,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52571aec760ee3776a199392","air_date":"1971-01-12","episodes":[{"air_date":"1971-01-12","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":128186,"name":"Meet the Bunkers","overview":"It's Edith and Archie Bunker's wedding anniversary.

Mike has serious reservations over allowing in-laws Archie and Edith to get custody of Joey, particularly due to what he perceives as Archie's bad influences.
