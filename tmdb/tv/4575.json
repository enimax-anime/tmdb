Mom insists that Lizzie play it at least once, so she recruits reluctant Miranda and Gordo for a game. The girls can't understand the incredibly complex rules but Gordo likes it. In fact, Gordo joins a \"\"Dwarf Tribe\"\" at school (led by Tudgeman, of course) and begins to spend all his time playing and thinking about the game. Gordo gets so obsessed that he even quits studying and, unbelievably, gets an \"\"F\"\" on a test!\n\nLizzie and Miranda try to talk some sense back into Gordo but he refuses to see he is addicted to the game. Matt agrees to help the girls capture Gordo and help to deprogram him. They stealthily invade a Dwarflord game, abduct Gordo and hold an intervention in which they finally convince him to go back to his old lifestyle.","production_code":"","runtime":22,"season_number":1,"show_id":4575,"still_path":"/hWNTVXvPp0eJpshSltieBEGayFa.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52577207760ee36aaa4ab7e9","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87565,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Savage Steve Holland","original_name":"Savage Steve Holland","popularity":2.866,"profile_path":"/3GADF4j8wNAxPJIsipQnrd2ieTt.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52577207760ee36aaa4ab691","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1225404,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Douglas Tuber","original_name":"Douglas Tuber","popularity":0.84,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52577207760ee36aaa4ab6a7","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1225405,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Tim Maile","original_name":"Tim Maile","popularity":0.84,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Larry Tudgeman","credit_id":"52577207760ee36aaa4ab793","order":503,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212950,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kyle Downes","original_name":"Kyle Downes","popularity":2.744,"profile_path":"/A5bkWWQQKbHj3ELM24XVJE6EQsO.jpg"},{"character":"Edward Sánchez","credit_id":"5e30623cfd140b00176d4dd3","order":559,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1594095,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Armando Molina","original_name":"Armando Molina","popularity":1.55,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Danielle Sánchez","credit_id":"5e306395ac8e6b0018be0481","order":562,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":104382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dyana Ortelli","original_name":"Dyana Ortelli","popularity":3.753,"profile_path":"/5ucJJBjifV9tEiVWnTLFy8OUrzF.jpg"},{"character":"Veruca Albano","credit_id":"5e2f220c4ca676001249be84","order":573,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1226451,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Rachel Snow","original_name":"Rachel Snow","popularity":1.22,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":"2001-11-30","episode_number":28,"episode_type":"standard","id":330318,"name":"Lizzie and Kate's Big Adventure","overview":"Gordo and Miranda visit Lizzie after she was out sick and bring her some scary news--in social studies class she has to pair up on a project with---KATE!!
