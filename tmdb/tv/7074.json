However, for the first time since the beginning of ABDC, DJ Rashida was not present as the show's DJ, as she was touring with Lady Gaga and JabbaWockeeZ. Preceding the first broadcast, MTV announced in a broadcast trailer that the show would be moving to its new Sunday night slot at 9pm ET/PT for the duration of the season. In Canada, MuchMusic aired this season at the same time as its MTV broadcast. In previous seasons, it was aired 3 days after MTV aired it. Unlike previous seasons, there was no live audition special. In the live season finale, We Are Heroes was declared the winner of Season 4 and received the $100,000 prize.\n\nOn August 2, 2009, as a prologue for the season, the show premiered a special hosted by Randy Jackson called \"The Top 10 Performances of All Time\", where Randy showed his top 10 routines from the first three seasons.\n\nThis was also the last season to feature Shane Sparks as a judge.",
