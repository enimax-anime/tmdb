But with so many fishermen and so many fishing disciplines how can we find out who is best of the best?\n\nThis competition isn't just about who catches the most and who catches the biggest.  It's also about who hosts the ultimate fishing trip.  Each competitor will be proficient in a very different fishing discipline: fly fishing, spear fishing, noodling for instance - and they'll be tasked with laying on the perfect experience.  However, one man’s noodling might not be anybody else’s cup of tea.  Each host will have to work hard to convince the others that their type of fishing is the best.","popularity":4.087,"poster_path":"/qfPL2eOCO5aUsmxy2dYiEjT92nc.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":7521,"logo_path":"/fRqMjLjyAqThtEg9P9WKCXLmCpJ.png","name":"National Geographic","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2013-04-27","episode_count":10,"id":157820,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/qfPL2eOCO5aUsmxy2dYiEjT92nc.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5f252cf8d94035003754689f","air_date":"2013-04-27","episodes":[{"air_date":"2013-04-27","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":2373079,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"Three anglers from opposite corners of the globe come together to prove they are the best, both at home and abroad.
