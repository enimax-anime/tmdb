They encounter a mother and daughter who catch the picking bug and give the guys a run for their money. And with nerves of steel, they try to strike deals with people who are often reluctant to part with their possessions.

They find rare cars and motorcycles that you won't find back in the states but they aren't able to seal every negotiation since they have to factor in the exchange rate between Euros and dollars, and the cost of shipping everything back home. Back in the states, Mike and Frank will once again haggle over a slew of interesting historic items and meet quirky and interesting characters. From rare Bonnie and Clyde memorabilia to a Bass Guitar that may have belonged to Bill Black, a legendary musician who played with Elvis, to a typewriter that supposedly was lent to Albert Einstein.

In upcoming episodes, Mike and Frank cover new territory, picking in New Mexico for the first time ever. It wouldn't be American Pickers without amazing classic cars, and this season features two particularly rare ones: a 1954 Red Nash Healey Coupe and a 1954 Grey Nash Healey Coupe.

As their junkyard journeys continue, the pickers rummage through ramshackle school buses, a burned storage building, forgotten barns, salvage yards, and rust heaps in search of what they call \"good junk.\" They come across an item they've never seen before, place bets on what it actually is, and get a surprising assessment from the appraiser. They encounter a mother and daughter who catch the picking bug and give the guys a run for their money. And with nerves of steel, they try to strike deals with people who are often reluctant to part with their possessions. Meanwhile, back in Iowa, Danielle Colby Cushman holds down the fort at Antique Archaeology.",

They next visit a collector, Keith, who doesn't want to sell, but they convince him to loan a rare Dog River Confederate sword to the museum. They also buy a Springfield musket and canteen. But their picking skills are put to the test when they spot a Union frock coat. It's at the top of the museum's wish list, but can they negotiate a sale and keep within the museum's tight budget? In addition, the guys experience a Civil War adventure when they sign up with a local re-enactment group. As Captains on opposite sides they go into battle, leading their respective troops.",

Purchased for a mere $450, the bone is priceless, according to the paleontology museum curator who appraises it. In subsequent episodes, the duo will \"pick\" a speedy cycle car, crafted from the wing tank of a WWII-era plane; the work of iconic painter Norman Rockwell; a 350-pound taxidermy African elephant head, which they ultimately swap in exchange for a vintage photo booth and jukebox; and two coin-operated \"peek-a-boo\" strip poker machines from the 1950's. As Mike and Frank demonstrate, no two treasures, no two adventures and no two episodes are alike.",

In upcoming episodes, Mike and Frank cover new territory, picking in New Mexico for the first time ever.

Also coming up, the guys find a building chock full of Star Wars memorabilia including a life-sized Storm Trooper and Yoda, causing Frank to geek out. A lot is at stake when Frank makes a big bet with Mike: If Mike can down six dozen oysters then Frank has to shave his beard.",
