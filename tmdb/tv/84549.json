Locked doors burst open, while others refuse to come unlocked and hundred pound objects are tossed across the room. Things come to a boil when the spirit manifests in the back of her car and offers a dire warning. Hospital volunteer Bettina has a spectacular gift -- she can heal the sick.

Using her gift to rescue a coma patient attracts the attention of a dark entity eager to drain her power and increase his own. A paranormal radio show host wasn't expecting to have to have emergency surgery. The unexpected escalates when he wakes up in a recovery room populated by angry and aggravated spirits.",

The thrill quickly turns to fear as they're terrorized by the night-time appearance of the Shadow Man. A formerly dormant clairvoyance rises to the surface as Sandrea attempts to banish the spectral spirit in a final confrontation. Set in the late 1980s a group of construction workers are about to swing the wrecking ball and demolish an outdated hospital. Two men, sent inside to make a final check, hear children. Seeking the kids, they become trapped in a room and unable to open the door as the sound of the wrecking ball gets closer and closer. Lab Technician Donald was a man of science until he began working at a hospital overflowing with paranormal history. A mix of poltergeists, crying ghost babies and the spirit of a dead doctor transform his cynical skepticism into pure belief.",
