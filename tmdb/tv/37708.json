Ruth and Dr Rachael meet a mother and daughter at loggerheads because the daughter refuses to go on the pill. \n\nSeventeen-year-old Rachel fell pregnant by accident last year and her mum Michelle is at a loss trying to get her daughter to protect herself from another unwanted pregnancy. While Ruth helps the pair to communicate better, can Dr Rachael find a suitable method of contraception for the teenager? \n\nRuth also meets 20-year-old Calvin from Liverpool. Calvin is gay and works as a drag queen on the club scene, but he's yet to have a sexual partner and is scared to lose his virginity. Sex coach Joanna gives him some helpful advice on foreplay to get him more accustomed to the idea of anal sex. \n\nNext into the clinic is Holly, 20, who takes the contraceptive pill but rarely uses condoms because she doesn't think the kind of guy she sleeps with would carry sexually transmitted infections - even though the fastest growing STI, chlamydia, has no visible symptoms. But Holly is shocked when Dr Rachael presents her with some cold hard facts about STIs. \n\nAlso looking for sex advice are 17-year-old lesbian Kim, keen to learn some more tricks for girls; sportsman Genna, 18, who is worried his sperm isn't normal; and 20-year-old Robyn who asks Ruth for help to make her boyfriend's semen more palatable!","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":37708,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-01-26","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":850850,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"Two teens who hate their boobs pay a visit to Dr Rachael.

The pair are engaged to be married, but there's one problem threatening to create a wedge in their relationship, Luke cannot bring himself to perform oral sex on his fianc√©e as he has a phobia of vaginas. Desperate to make Michaela happy, Lukes takes a masterclass in female anatomy from sex coach Joanna, and visits a sculptor who helps him get to grips with Michaela's vagina in a whole new way. \n\nChloe (19) and Louis (20) face an altogether different kind of obstacle. They've been together for three years and have an active sex life everywhere (including up trees!). But not at Louis' house - his parents can't come to terms with the fact that the couple are sexually active, and Chloe has to sleep on the sofa. They want to broach the subject with Louis' parents, but have no idea how to do so without upsetting them. Ruth is on hand to offer some practical advice on how to have a frank discussion with them. \n\nAlso in the programme, 19-year-old Luke gets some tips on bondage from Joanna to help spice up his sex life; Mo talks to Dr Rachael about premature ejaculation and how he can overcome it; and Harriet wants to know just how painful it's going to be when she loses her virginity.
