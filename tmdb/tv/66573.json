It is absolutely perfect. The only problem is Eleanor isn’t supposed to be in The Good Place. In fact, her life decisions wouldn’t have even gotten her close.

With a snap of her fingers, the Judge sent the humans back to Earth, in a new timeline where they never died. Also seeking redemption, along with Eleanor, are Senegalese philosopher Chidi Anagonye, who is tortured by decision-making; elegant Pakistani-British socialite Tahani Al-Jamil, and dance-obsessed Floridian Jason Mendoza. Michael is aided by Janet, a human-esque repository for all of the knowledge in the universe. However, when Michael and Janet begin interfering with the humans' lives, to make sure they wind up in The Good Place, they're going against the Judge's orders and on borrowed time. When The Bad Place gets involved, Michael and Janet must ask themselves, just how far they'll go to keep the humans out of The Bad Place.","poster_path":"/3dJDT1dVSuHBYqWD0OLT1ZXeLq7.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":7.7},{"air_date":"2019-09-26","episode_count":13,"id":125516,"name":"Season 4","overview":"The experiment on self-improvement in the afterlife begins.

Once these deceptions have been uncovered, the four human test subjects are Chidi himself, Simone, gossip columnist John, and entitled chauvinist Brent. Eleanor and the rest of the team encourage the four to become friends, study ethics together, and improve as people. By the conclusion of the year-long experiment, all but Brent have shown moral improvement, and even Brent shows potential for change at the last minute. The Judge decides that the afterlife system is indeed flawed—but to mend it, all of humanity must be erased from existence.","poster_path":"/tdz3ifKz3G0gYfEmGf1EpMzny9n.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":7.7}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"What the fork?!","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8,"vote_count":1272,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"57431532925141111a0022fb","air_date":"2016-09-19","episodes":[{"air_date":"2016-09-19","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1195668,"name":"Everything Is Fine","overview":"Newly-deceased Eleanor Shellstrop is sent to the Good Place, but only by mistake; Eleanor is determined to become a better person in her afterlife with help from friends Chidi and Janet; Eleanor tries to prove to Chidi that she's worthy of his help.","production_code":"101","runtime":23,"season_number":1,"show_id":66573,"still_path":"/n6yqPpZk4geXG2j5kWF6ycC0ROo.jpg","vote_average":7.6,"vote_count":55,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"578e2545c3a3681796003559","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47506,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Drew Goddard","original_name":"Drew Goddard","popularity":4.634,"profile_path":"/rcxxyIGDgPkXVgAQb9LLXfR89pv.jpg"},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"587bd706c3a36847e8013a46","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":47506,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Drew Goddard","original_name":"Drew Goddard","popularity":4.634,"profile_path":"/rcxxyIGDgPkXVgAQb9LLXfR89pv.jpg"},{"job":"Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"5fa0392e7e34830037a3ae23","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1023495,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Colin Patton","original_name":"Colin Patton","popularity":1.158,"profile_path":"/manEoVVbHxjPhpHyPmYW6FlujZU.jpg"},{"job":"Stunts","department":"Crew","credit_id":"5fa0395a2790bf0036486457","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1410448,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Shane Daniels","original_name":"Shane Daniels","popularity":1.732,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Stunts","department":"Crew","credit_id":"5fa039750cb335003861ff41","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1005944,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Mandy Kowalski","original_name":"Mandy Kowalski","popularity":4.317,"profile_path":"/pWglkDC4t8TzNAxV7K2Ugniy7yp.jpg"},{"job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","credit_id":"5fa038f5ede1b00037e68930","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":54164,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Barry Peterson","original_name":"Barry Peterson","popularity":4.239,"profile_path":"/ytcFXXAzadbSF3uLeIL2XDAejB5.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Gloria","credit_id":"59a6c2da92514112ef00e3ee","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1211945,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jill Remez","original_name":"Jill Remez","popularity":6.065,"profile_path":"/zYNmrHsV1SpSbXyDPwiBC77E7mt.jpg"},{"character":"Wallace","credit_id":"59a6c32392514112ef00e430","order":526,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":212290,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Seth Morris","original_name":"Seth Morris","popularity":3.663,"profile_path":"/A66wu5p48sSDEKf0uqWXQROcroW.jpg"},{"character":"Good Woman","credit_id":"5b07cd799251417236003a7a","order":531,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1450400,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jamila Webb","original_name":"Jamila Webb","popularity":1.342,"profile_path":"/vwyF3kPejevsj9rOtQMq56TgQIb.jpg"},{"character":"Sachveer","credit_id":"5b07cd670e0a267b6600402d","order":553,"adult":false,"gender":3,"id":2050341,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ru Kazi","original_name":"Ru Kazi","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Bambadjan","credit_id":"59a362b1925141775b04b5a9","order":658,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":965219,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Bambadjan Bamba","original_name":"Bambadjan Bamba","popularity":3.321,"profile_path":"/6Uk5XX0zRDYJeeIkjgtScS5zjFG.jpg"},{"character":"Joe","credit_id":"59a6c2f6925141129300e57e","order":691,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1866130,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Hartman","original_name":"John Hartman","popularity":8.309,"profile_path":"/wVs9ncZ28tEIURhPLaXbOq53F4Q.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2016-09-19","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1223504,"name":"Flying","overview":"Eleanor tries to prove to Chidi that she is worthy of his help.

With a snap of her fingers, the Judge sent the humans back to Earth, in a new timeline where they never died. Also seeking redemption, along with Eleanor, are Senegalese philosopher Chidi Anagonye, who is tortured by decision-making; elegant Pakistani-British socialite Tahani Al-Jamil, and dance-obsessed Floridian Jason Mendoza. Michael is aided by Janet, a human-esque repository for all of the knowledge in the universe. However, when Michael and Janet begin interfering with the humans' lives, to make sure they wind up in The Good Place, they're going against the Judge's orders and on borrowed time. When The Bad Place gets involved, Michael and Janet must ask themselves, just how far they'll go to keep the humans out of The Bad Place.","id":105508,"poster_path":"/3dJDT1dVSuHBYqWD0OLT1ZXeLq7.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":7.7},"4":{"_id":"5cfb30edc3a3687f181e0690","air_date":"2019-09-26","episodes":[{"air_date":"2019-09-26","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1879380,"name":"A

Shawn repeatedly tries to sabotage the experiment, first by sending a demon to impersonate one of the test subjects, and then by having a Bad Janet impersonate Janet. Once these deceptions have been uncovered, the four human test subjects are Chidi himself, Simone, gossip columnist John, and entitled chauvinist Brent. Eleanor and the rest of the team encourage the four to become friends, study ethics together, and improve as people. By the conclusion of the year-long experiment, all but Brent have shown moral improvement, and even Brent shows potential for change at the last minute. The Judge decides that the afterlife system is indeed flawed—but to mend it, all of humanity must be erased from existence.","id":125516,"poster_path":"/tdz3ifKz3G0gYfEmGf1EpMzny9n.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":7.7}}}
