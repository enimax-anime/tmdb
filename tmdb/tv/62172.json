Although Falco originally took on the assignment to avoid spending 20 years in prison on drug charges, it eventually evolved into a quest for justice for him. “Gangland Undercover” documents the lives of outlaw bikers, who live in a world in which respect is earned through fear. The series is based on Falco's memoir, “Vagos, Mongols, and Outlaws,” and documented historical research of gang rivalries.","popularity":8.69,"poster_path":"/uUmANMGhx0vaw2vfvT0JdRtdQGs.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2015-02-24","episode_count":6,"id":65339,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/qOes37zP4BCqqdpNHXdZPx1Rd4e.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":8.3},{"air_date":"2017-03-02","episode_count":8,"id":80542,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":7}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":37,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"55043f08c3a36862e5000e38","air_date":"2015-02-24","episodes":[{"air_date":"2015-02-24","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1046935,"name":"Going Under","overview":"Charles Falco manages to infiltrate the notorious Vagos biker gang.
