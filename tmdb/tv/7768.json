Star Blazers was first broadcast in the United States in 1979. Significantly, it was the first popular English-translated anime that had an overarching plot and storyline that required the episodes to be shown in order. It dealt with somewhat more mature themes than other productions aimed at the same target audience at the time. As a result, it paved the way for future arc-based, plot-driven anime translations.","popularity":4.017,"poster_path":"/1hrR7MzzHjyuLDp6ldFkzzIARIk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":66226,"logo_path":null,"name":"Sunwagon Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":66227,"logo_path":null,"name":"Claster Television Productions","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":41,"id":17931,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1979-10-01","episode_count":26,"id":17928,"name":"Season 1","overview":"In the year 2199, a starship must make a dangerous voyage to the distant planet Iscandar and back to save Earth from an alien invasion.","poster_path":"/NBucqNuYmB2AsyR3iYwddBr1ti.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1978-10-14","episode_count":26,"id":17929,"name":"Season 2","overview":"In the year 2202, a restored Earth faces a new threat: The Comet Empire, bent on conquest of the universe i sheading straight to Earth.","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1985-10-11","episode_count":25,"id":17930,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.3,"vote_count":9,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52578e1d760ee36aaa6a87b8","air_date":"1979-10-01","episodes":[{"air_date":"1979-10-01","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":390826,"name":"The Sleeping Giant","overview":"The first episode of Star Blazers (\"Space Battleship Yamato\") is born.\n\nThe earth is being decimitaed by meteor bombs from outer space which is slowly poisoning the earth.

Desslok plans to use the gas, and an electromagnetic force net, to chase the Star Force into the corona of a red giant star, Voltan -- The Sea of Fire. He is so confident of his new invention that he tells General Krypt not to bother reporting on the success, and strides off to his bedroom to dream of the conquest of other worlds.\n\nThe Gamilons begin their offensive by ensnaring the Argo in a powerful electromagnetic space net, and then sending a volley of missiles. Captain Avatar suffers a black-out, which he attributes to an earlier battle wound, and fails to order their interception. Wildstar initiates it instead, without the order, leading to a later reprimand. The ship barely manages to pull out of the space net and evade the Gamilon missiles. Dr. Sane knows the real reason for Avatar's collapse -- radiation poisoning. Privately, he urges Avatar to consider hospitalisation, a suggestion which Avatar adamantly rejects.\n\nWith the Star Force's flight path restricted by the space net, the Gamilons then loose Desslok's Ecto Gas upon the Star Force from behind, forcing them to flee toward the Red Star of Voltan. There is no choice but to fly dangerously close to the corona, and the ship and crew are on the verge of melting. But, the plan backfires when the ecto gas is drawn into the Sea of Fire, and the Star Force clears a safe path through the fire with a blast of the Wave Motion Gun.\n\nOn Gamilon, Desslok rebuffs his aide General Krypt's suggestion that they send out interceptors, and instead suggests sending congratulations. He muses to himself, \"How could the Star Force have escaped? ...It was a perfect trap!\"\n\nEarth has 308 days left.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":7768,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52578e1d760ee36aaa6a881f","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78014,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leiji Matsumoto","original_name":"Leiji Matsumoto","popularity":6.971,"profile_path":"/muSDczQxWUkLQQuwVvLO8fSdshM.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1979-10-01","episode_number":13,"episode_type":"standard","id":390838,"name":"Know Thine Enemy","overview":"A Gamilon pilot is captured and the Star Force interrogates him, as Wildstar's personal tragedy comes into play.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":7768,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52578e1d760ee36aaa6a881f","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78014,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leiji Matsumoto","original_name":"Leiji Matsumoto","popularity":6.971,"profile_path":"/muSDczQxWUkLQQuwVvLO8fSdshM.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1979-10-01","episode_number":14,"episode_type":"standard","id":390839,"name":"The Worst of Times","overview":"Tensions mount on the Argo as she is trapped in a space storm.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":7768,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52578e1d760ee36aaa6a881f","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78014,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Leiji Matsumoto","original_name":"Leiji Matsumoto","popularity":6.971,"profile_path":"/muSDczQxWUkLQQuwVvLO8fSdshM.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1979-10-01","episode_number":15,"episode_type":"standard","id":390840,"name":"The Galactic Whirlpool","overview":"Desslok commissions Gamilon General and war hero Lysis to defeat the Star Force.

Since that time, no longer threatened by outside forces, Earth has recovered and expanded its naval power and terrirory to the periphery of the Solar System. Most of the Star Force crew are assigned to various posts on Earth, although the Argo is currently on assignment as the flagship of the Solar System's peripheral defence patrol fleet. Commanding it is Deputy Captain Derek Wildstar.\n\nUnknown to Earth, a new threat lurks in outer space. In the palace of the Comet Empire -- a huge mobile city fortress shrouded in a plasma field which makes it resemble a white comet -- its green-skinned ruler, Prince Zordar, plans for his next conquest, Earth. His minions, daughter Princess Invidia, and Generals Dire and Gorse, gather to review the plans for the Earth, the defenses of which are deemed vastly inferior. An easy victory is predicted.\n\nBut suddenly, a surprising voice pierces the air. Gamilon Leader Desslok steps out of the shadows of the throne room to chide the court for its overconfidence. They have failed to consider the Star Force. Invidia, immediately showing her disdain for the former Gamilon ruler, scoffs at this, asking whether this is the same Star Force which single-handedly wrecked Gamilon. Desslok scoffs at her arrogance, and insists that unless the Star Force is dealt with, the Comet Empire will be unsuccessful. He convinces Emperor Zordar to allow him to personally take care of the Star Force.\n\nMeanwhile, Comet Empire strike planes begin stealth attacks on Earth's defence patrol fleet. Wildstar takes his Superstar flighter out on a solo mission to chase the mysterious enemy, only to be called back to the ship which has been crippled by an enormous EMF surge which has passed through the Solar System. The surge burns up many of the Argo's electrical circuits, but the communication system holds out long enough to record a garbled radio message from an unknown source. Could it be related to this new enemy, they wonder.\n\nAs the damaged Argo returns to Earth, it crosses flight paths with Earth's new flagship, Andromeda, commanded by Captain Gideon, on its maiden flight. Each captain masks pride with principle, and refuses to yield airspace. The two ships come within mere meters of collision.
