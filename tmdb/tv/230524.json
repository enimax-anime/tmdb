Raised with the knowledge that she was never loved by either her parents or her younger sister, Han Yoo-ra.\n\nNow an adult, Yi-joo finds joy in her work as a painter, but in all other aspects, her life is much the same as it’s always been. Married to a man who does not love her, Yi-joo has simply moved from one house without love into another. Even so, she is devastated when she learns that her husband is desperately in love with her younger sister. Willing to give just about anything to change her fate, Yi-joo might have taken action but a tragic accident cuts all her hopes for a better future short.  Waking from that fatal accident, Yi-joo finds herself transported back in time. Teaming up with Seo Do-guk, the heir to a vast fortune, will Yi-joo find a way to make for herself the life she’s always wanted?",
