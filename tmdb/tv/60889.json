Aside from the political minefields she has to walk, Charlie has a close personal relationship with the President because she was once engaged to her son before a tragic terrorist attack took his life. Charlie survived that attack and is now determined to bring the perpetrators to justice.\n\nNavigating a complex personal life and a pressure-cooker profession is, of course, a challenge, and Charlie sometimes engages in boundary-pushing behavior to avoid facing her grief. But when the clock strikes 2 a.m., she is all about her job - protecting her nation, serving her president and still trying to get to the bottom of her fiancé's murder that will reveal itself as a shocking mystery.","popularity":1.312,"poster_path":"/2a4kzJHXFzPYXV09XmRe9OM58L8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3929,"logo_path":null,"name":"Robert Simonds Productions","origin_country":"US"},{"id":25038,"logo_path":null,"name":"Abishag Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":26727,"logo_path":"/jeTxdjXhzgKZyLr3l9MllkTn3fy.png","name":"Universal Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2014-11-17","episode_count":13,"id":61086,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/fU2inFH0xbKlnnP1d9fnyoUJN5i.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":6.6}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.568,"vote_count":59,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5398c1dd0e0a266dbb00dbba","air_date":"2014-11-17","episodes":[{"air_date":"2014-11-17","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":988568,"name":"Pilot","overview":"Charlie Tucker and President Payton attempt to come up with a plan to avenge the death of Payton's son, who was killed in Kabul after a diplomatic convoy was attacked.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":60889,"still_path":"/e4VJf31iPoIuhcbRC5oqLNz9o8L.jpg","vote_average":6.3,"vote_count":7,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"59b93cc09251417e5d013051","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40223,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joe Carnahan","original_name":"Joe Carnahan","popularity":5.491,"profile_path":"/e6cnnUqh6mGIjnRFI4xFc30AqVr.jpg"},{"job":"Story","department":"Writing","credit_id":"59b9438bc3a36813ae0132e3","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67855,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexi Hawley","original_name":"Alexi Hawley","popularity":6.993,"profile_path":"/eIyGbyHTfsIxEOPlD5lByW9A80y.jpg"},{"job":"Teleplay","department":"Writing","credit_id":"59b94375c3a36813bc014576","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1887326,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Susan Morris","original_name":"Susan Morris","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Teleplay","department":"Writing","credit_id":"59b943829251417e08013e93","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67855,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Alexi Hawley","original_name":"Alexi Hawley","popularity":6.993,"profile_path":"/eIyGbyHTfsIxEOPlD5lByW9A80y.jpg"},{"job":"Teleplay","department":"Writing","credit_id":"59b9430bc3a3681405013f70","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":40223,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joe Carnahan","original_name":"Joe Carnahan","popularity":5.491,"profile_path":"/e6cnnUqh6mGIjnRFI4xFc30AqVr.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2014-11-24","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1017075,"name":"Secrets & Lies","overview":"The team scrambles against the Russians over a stranded submarine that houses U.S. secrets.
