John Hoyt plays a doctor who begins to assume the man is dead, but really, everyone is unsure, and worried.  The entire episode concerns the issue of mercy killing.  Richard Rust plays a young man named Corey who is deathly afraid of heights but who tries to get down to the man to make certain.  At one point, they even feel perhaps they should shoot the man just in case he's alive.  This episode shows exactly why the show is called a psychological drama western.  It is very intense and intellectual, with superb acting.  The other two characters are a man who hides his fear by constantly laughing and a man who cannot stop saying he cannot take risks because he has a family.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":3,"show_id":10980,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525809f919c29531db3ef41e","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":51875,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Andrew V.
