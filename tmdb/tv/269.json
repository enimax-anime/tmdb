Arrogant and assured, Nathan is the star of the high school basketball team and hails from a wealthy family. Quiet and driven, Lucas is the only child of a single working mom. Now the two boys' lives collide when a twist of fate puts Lucas on Nathan's team and the half-brothers compete, not only for control of the court, but also for the heart of Nathan's beautiful girlfriend Peyton.  Years in the making, a deep and bitter conflict slowly unfolds as the two boys struggle to come to terms with who they really are, and a father who has chosen to live vicariously through one son, while ignoring the existence of the other.","id":849,"poster_path":"/ka6laSHS9CHrDCGFxw8mcNIbZ6o.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":8.1},"2":{"_id":"525349cf19c29579400ebf90","air_date":"2004-09-21","episodes":[{"air_date":"2004-09-21","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":14411,"name":"The Desperate Kingdom of Love","overview":"After Lucas and Keith learn that Dan had a heart attack and is still in the hospital, they decide it is best for them to return to Tree Hill.
