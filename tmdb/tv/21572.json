But it was all based on lies. His company, The Stanford Financial Group, made its name selling what’s usually a safe bet for investors – certificates of deposits. He claimed the CDs came from his offshore bank on the island of Antigua, and because of that, the company offered return rates higher than those in the U.S. When the lies grew too big and his money supply dried out – he was convicted of running an international $7 billion Ponzi scheme, and is serving a 110-year sentence in federal prison. He left a trail of some 20,000 burned investors, many of whom now live in financial ruin.",
