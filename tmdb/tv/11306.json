The series also featured Linden Chiles as Steve Kirk and James T. Callahan, formerly of ABC's Wendy and Me sitcom, in the role of Lieutenant O'Connell. Among the guest stars were Dennis Hopper, Jack Palance, Barbara Rush, James Doohan, Leslie Nielsen, Horst Ebersberg, Harold Gould, and Jeremy Slate.\n\nConvoy was one of the last NBC series in black and white; the use of stock footage made color impossible. As a result, several NBC affiliates refused to clear the program, which consequently failed to climb out of the 'bottom 10' in the Nielsen ratings. The program premiered on September 17, 1965, and the last episode aired on December 10.","popularity":2.896,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":26727,"logo_path":"/jeTxdjXhzgKZyLr3l9MllkTn3fy.png","name":"Universal
