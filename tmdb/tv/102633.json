Oxford historian Dr Janina Ramirez helps them decode the symbolism on these ancient relics to show that the sword may have been used in the First Crusade when Christian knights retook the holy city of Jerusalem, and that the helmet, embossed with the Lion of St Mark, was made in Venice.\n\nTravelling to Italy’s ‘floating city’, Carl and Hamilton learn more about how and why Venice adopted St Mark as its patron saint and went on to become a leading maritime power – eventually supplying crucial ships for the Crusades. They also discover that, on the way to Jerusalem, the Venetians chose to attack the Christian city of Constantinople to recoup losses they had sustained in building the fleet.\n\nIn the archives Janina discovers a powerful and vivid first-hand account of the “Sack of Constantinople” by a government official who was living in the city at the time.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":102633,"still_path":"/yHiwznHH1q4H1M8ZVFt6vfec7fi.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2021-09-13","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":3200580,"name":"Celtic Gold","overview":"Carl and Hamilton investigate an extraordinary collection of Celtic gold from the Iberian Peninsula that dates back thousands of years. Amongst the rare artefacts are a gold bowl worth over £1m, fine pieces of jewellery depicting the goddess Astarte, and a stone altar to the god Endovelicus which might have been used in rituals that involved blood sacrifice.\n\nTravelling to Portugal, where most of the Celtic gold is from, Carl and Hamilton meet up with Joao, their long-time local guide and collaborator. The three men travel to the site of a very rare temple devoted to Endovelicus and explore how the temple might have been used to worship the god.\n\nCarl and Hamilton meet up with forensic archaeologist and former police detective Roger Box. They want to find out more about the Roman symbolism that appears on the Celtic altar, and Roger takes them to the site of a Roman temple in the Cotswolds.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":102633,"still_path":"/72KIqRZwW9CKc6K44XTexj4GWMz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2021-09-20","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":3201948,"name":"Knights Templar Chalice","overview":"Carl and Hamilton are back on more familiar ground with a stunning white marble chalice from Hamilton’s Knights Templar treasure hoard, where the relics they explored in the first series came from.\n\nThey travel to Chartres Cathedral in France, believed to have been built by the Templars, to examine a depiction of a very similar chalice on the north portico. Inside the Cathedral they also come across a famous depiction of a black Madonna which is at the centre of a Christian cult and was also revered by the Templars.\n\nWanting to find out more about the cult of the black Madonna, Carl and Hamilton travel to a spot in the south of France which has given rise to an extraordinary theory – made popular by the novel and movie The Da Vinci Code – that Mary Magdalene travelled from the Holy Land after the crucifixion and was carrying Jesus’ child.\n\nBack in the UK, Janina looks at some of the sources that inspired The Da Vinci Code.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":102633,"still_path":"/9QrcaYp1x8PNBXLYghA8bpD5fOJ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2021-09-27","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":3201949,"name":"Pilgrim Warriors","overview":"In Hamilton’s possession is a wooden chest stuffed full of relics from medieval Christian pilgrimages.

One is of a pilgrim clad in a cloak and carrying a book and staff; the other is very similar except that he is carrying a spear.\n\nCarl and Hamilton’s journey starts in the south of France, the traditional starting point of the Camino. They traverse the Pyrenees, stopping off at key landmarks like Charlemagne’s Cross, where pilgrims lay tributes and say prayers to St James.  Descending the other side of the Pyrenees and crossing into Spain, Carl and Hamilton come to a strategic castle that was a flashpoint during the bloody war fought between Christian and Muslim forces for control of this region in the Middle Ages.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":102633,"still_path":"/9AWvp8vFyD8hDuPDLGiRTnk7bs9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2021-10-04","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"finale","id":3201950,"name":"Nazi Relics","overview":"Hamilton has amassed an extraordinary collection of Nazi memorabilia.
