From a booby trapped cannabis farm in a suburban semi to an elderly farmer's wife with a shotgun, the stories are surprising and exciting. There will be more absurd altercations - such as a middle-class dog-napping or fisticuffs between pensioners - as well as the daily grind of speeding drivers, city-centre shoplifters and Saturday night drinkers.","popularity":4.08,"poster_path":"/zR2NV5jfDmMbSVGuyh531dfAhT0.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":686,"logo_path":"/qMVjV8YFbxXrGVF4wD6hRjllVbr.png","name":"Tiger Aspect Productions","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2015-10-28","episode_count":8,"id":71704,"name":"Series 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/6rnPU6hhQozRCmn9edVxwNWIuaN.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":10}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.2,"vote_count":26,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"56347722c3a3681b5c01725d","air_date":"2015-10-28","episodes":[{"air_date":"2015-10-28","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1133322,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"Rookie cop Jake Vickers faces a tough first day on the job with everything from a suicidal mental patient to an outrageous shoplifter.
