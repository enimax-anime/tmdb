Ralph, fully aware of the resentment from his band mates, requests more parts for them to sing. The album is a huge hit; but Bobby's behavior gets more erratic and outlandish while on the road. Eventually tensions erupt, and the group dynamic takes a pivotal change - the boys vote to kick Bobby out - and New Edition is never the same. Soon Ralph decides that he wants to go solo, leaving remaining members Ricky, Mike, and Ronnie stunned. Mike, the group's de facto leader, adds R&amp;B singer Johnny Gill to the group. Everything comes to an ugly head when the group meets to record their next album.","production_code":"","runtime":80,"season_number":1,"show_id":69760,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Soul Train Producer","credit_id":"62ae505e1bf2660092cc8da1","order":501,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2247642,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandee Evans","original_name":"Brandee Evans","popularity":4.713,"profile_path":"/hNN64CCJEgsIIELJ8qG1LAgkzI4.jpg"},{"character":"Flo DeVoe","credit_id":"62ae51132b9320006133d9a0","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1034453,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"La La Anthony","original_name":"La La Anthony","popularity":11.536,"profile_path":"/34Ncdty8qOpdHSv75pI51GsitON.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2017-01-26","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"finale","id":1260436,"name":"Part 3","overview":"New Edition's \"Heartbreak\" tour is an incredible success and the group is soaring high.
