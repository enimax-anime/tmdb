In the company of Liz Bonnin and with Aussie outback-astronomer Greg Quicke as their guide to the southern sky, they reveal how the apparently monochrome sky at night is in fact a riot of glorious colour.\n\nBrian and Dara also reveal how Australia, which faces directly into the heart of our Milky Way galaxy, is in the front line when it comes to protecting our planet - whether it be from the threat of a giant asteroid impact or from contact with alien life. And we hear how the Aussie outback contains secrets that Nasa hope will lead them to alien life on Mars.\n\nAnd will viewers have managed to find the elusive missing ninth planet in our solar system?",

This time they explore what keeps Tim and his International Space Station crew-mates safe in the hazardous environment of space. Brian and Dara also welcome a very special guest to take the gravity challenge - and find out what it would feel like to walk on Mars and the Moon.\n\nRoving reporter Liz Bonnin once more reports live from the European Astronaut Centre in Cologne, where she tests whether comedian John Bishop has the 'right stuff'. A lifelong astronomy fan, John will be strapped into a giant centrifuge machine to experience how future astronauts will simulate gravity during missions into deep space.\n\nBrian and Dara are joined in the studio by Dame Jocelyn Bell-Burnell, to hear how she discovered the first pulsar star - giving astronomers all over the world one of their most precious tools for studying the universe. They also find out whether Stargazing viewers have discovered any new pulsars in their three-night search, training Jodrell's famous telescope onto them to reveal exactly what has been discovered, and how much that means to astronomers.",

But capping it all is the most remarkable view of the Milky Way, arching overhead like a river of stars. Join them live as they finish a long night under the stars, and as dawn approaches in Australia.\n\nBrian and Dara are joined by Liz Bonnin and Aussie outback-astronomer Greg Quicke as their guide to the southern sky. Surrounded by kangaroos, snakes and spiders, the team reveal the wonderful star-tales told by indigenous people, embark on a mission to catch a shooting star and celebrate Australia's role in rescuing the stricken Apollo 13 moon mission. Plus, we ask viewers' help in a challenge to find the missing ninth planet in the solar system.",

In the company of Liz Bonnin and with Aussie outback-astronomer Greg Quicke as their guide to the southern sky, they reveal how the apparently monochrome sky at night is in fact a riot of glorious colour.\n\nBrian and Dara also reveal how Australia, which faces directly into the heart of our Milky Way galaxy, is in the front line when it comes to protecting our planet - whether it be from the threat of a giant asteroid impact or from contact with alien life. And we hear how the Aussie outback contains secrets that Nasa hope will lead them to alien life on Mars.\n\nAnd will viewers have managed to find the elusive missing ninth planet in our solar system?",
