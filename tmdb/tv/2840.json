However before he can make his decision he is also recruited by the resistance, a group of humans who oppose the taelons being on Earth. Lead by Jonathan Doors, the resistance informs Boone that the taelons are not what they appear to be. The CVI implant brainwashes its subjects into following the taelon blindly, in effect controlling them. The resistance informs Boone that they can remove this aspect from the CVI on the condition that he works for both the taelons and the resistance. Boone accepts and now searches for the truth of why the taelons are on earth and if they are responsible for the death of his wife.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":2840,"still_path":"/reBMkGzWR6ycNkqnU6PVM2BgibW.jpg","vote_average":7.3,"vote_count":3,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257486b760ee36aaa0fbb41","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44134,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Allan Eastman","original_name":"Allan Eastman","popularity":1.842,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257486b760ee36aaa0fbb21","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1745,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gene Roddenberry","original_name":"Gene Roddenberry","popularity":5.409,"profile_path":"/qY3gWqAMDrrvNVUrwZ8lSa4IKtS.jpg"},{"job":"Stunt Coordinator","department":"Crew","credit_id":"5cd3d712c3a36869dcfb592e","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":8355,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Steve Lucescu","original_name":"Steve Lucescu","popularity":4.252,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"5cd3d6a892514103233b0f3a","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1016102,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Dave Goard","original_name":"Dave Goard","popularity":1.166,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Stunt Double","department":"Crew","credit_id":"5cd3d7380e0a265dee609407","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":81102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Todd Schroeder","original_name":"Todd Schroeder","popularity":2.446,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Stunts","department":"Crew","credit_id":"5cd3d768925141031b3b0d68","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1886944,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Darren McGuire","original_name":"Darren McGuire","popularity":0.853,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","credit_id":"5cd3d6800e0a265e066092b8","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":210899,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Michael McMurray","original_name":"Michael McMurray","popularity":1.05,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Little Girl","credit_id":"5257486b760ee36aaa0fbac5","order":514,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":265904,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Charlotte Arnold","original_name":"Charlotte Arnold","popularity":1.987,"profile_path":"/3nmxOt2BqULjVer8OpL1FYTleHR.jpg"},{"character":"Kate Boone","credit_id":"5257486b760ee36aaa0fbae3","order":515,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":69576,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Lisa Ryder","original_name":"Lisa Ryder","popularity":8.603,"profile_path":"/xw3GcIk3jDK4ZzzYHeog400mc6S.jpg"},{"character":"Mayor Ruiz","credit_id":"5cd3d5f3c3a36869cafb5bc6","order":516,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1185589,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Monique Mojica","original_name":"Monique Mojica","popularity":1.151,"profile_path":"/bEC3qKIMKoGhvuzViCDlAfzYmTD.jpg"},{"character":"Eddy Jordan","credit_id":"5cd3d62a0e0a265df1608f93","order":517,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1339087,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paul Boretski","original_name":"Paul Boretski","popularity":1.685,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Kwai-Ling Hong","credit_id":"5cd3d556c3a36869dcfb5667","order":554,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":98159,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Miranda Kwok","original_name":"Miranda Kwok","popularity":3.829,"profile_path":"/7xkXqadXOlCKVBWV5B3titnN5Bt.jpg"},{"character":"Lt.
