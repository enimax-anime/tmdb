More than 2,000 years after her, Bettany visits a vast desert catacomb where tens of thousands of mummified animals were once left as an offering. Further upstream, there is a chance to swim in the Nile, and look inside the tombs where Tutankhamen's discoverer, Howard Carter, first got hooked on Egypt. Bettany explores the longest tomb yet found, before heading to the Dendera temple, where Cleopatra herself may have once wowed her lover Julius Caesar.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":90905,"still_path":"/fCrrAU8Pc3TSZqnoi8we2UKmrak.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-06-28","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1845510,"name":"The Banks","overview":"Bettany visits the west bank of the Nile opposite Luxor where, for 500 years, the Ancient Egyptians buried their pharaohs in the Valley of the Kings, among them the boy-king Tutankhamun. However, the historian crosses the local hills to the Workers' Village, where generations of skilled royal tomb-builders lived. As it turns out, they also dumped masses of domestic rubbish, which is now giving some insight into the highs, lows and preoccupations of ancient Egyptians. Bettany then heads south on the Nile's oldest steam ship SS Sudan, which inspired Agatha Christie to write Death on the Nile.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":90905,"still_path":"/sTIHjegM2Ql1K8pO3FNEhPFvXts.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-07-05","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"finale","id":1845511,"name":"The Source","overview":"The historian reaches the southernmost stretches of the Egyptian Nile, though her 900-mile journey is not quite over as she joins archaeologists as they extract a giant stone message board from the foundations of the temple of the crocodile god Sobek.
