Alexx finds a bruise shaped like a hand imprint on the victim's back, proving that she was pushed in front of the bus, and her boyfriend, Jay Seaver, is the prime suspect. When one of Jay's office rivals also turns up dead, Jay reveals that he has a psychotic stalker, Claudia, who he thinks might kill to please him. However, when Jay hires a lawyer to protect Claudia, Horatio suspects that Jay may be more involved than they thought. Later, a man's body is discovered down an elevator shaft in a nearby building, and there is evidence to link the victims to a common killer. Meanwhile, Calleigh's father seeks her help when he fears that he may have killed someone after a night of drinking, and Horatio assigns a new CSI, Ryan Wolfe, to the case.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":3,"show_id":1620,"still_path":null,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"52570ddf760ee3776a091d87","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1212393,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Scott Lautanen","original_name":"Scott Lautanen","popularity":2.528,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"52570ddf760ee3776a091d4f","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1224315,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marc Dube","original_name":"Marc Dube","popularity":1.646,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Stunt Coordinator","department":"Crew","credit_id":"5df5397e26dac100125002fe","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433735,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jim Vickers","original_name":"Jim Vickers","popularity":4.042,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"5df5395dd1a89300127776bf","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1293958,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Mark C.

Evidence leads Horatio and the team to a drug smuggling operation where large snakes are suspected of be being used to bring illegal drugs into the country to avoid detection by customs. However, when Horatio finds that Clavo Cruz, a nemesis of Horatio's who hides behind his diplomatic immunity, may be behind the operation, the team must find a legal way to put the criminal behind bars. Meanwhile, Wolfe must find the truth when two women each claim that they are the real victim of identity theft and the other is the culprit.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":3,"show_id":1620,"still_path":null,"vote_average":6.5,"vote_count":2,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52570dd9760ee3776a09182b","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1214544,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ann Donahue","original_name":"Ann Donahue","popularity":3.047,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52570df6760ee3776a09383f","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1211947,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gloria Muzio","original_name":"Gloria Muzio","popularity":4.745,"profile_path":"/5KELZxUlQ5oUFM3dwVO7Aw4fqwr.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52570dea760ee3776a0926a7","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1222590,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Ildy Modrovich","original_name":"Ildy Modrovich","popularity":3.597,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Stunt Coordinator","department":"Crew","credit_id":"5df5397e26dac100125002fe","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1433735,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Jim Vickers","original_name":"Jim Vickers","popularity":4.042,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Stunts","department":"Crew","credit_id":"5dfe1e739824c80017dfae47","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2487444,"known_for_department":"Crew","name":"Noelle Kim","original_name":"Noelle Kim","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","credit_id":"5e0b956c9603310017046edc","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":205641,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Eagle Egilsson","original_name":"Eagle Egilsson","popularity":2.259,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Stunts","department":"Crew","credit_id":"5e0c623268b1ea00137c7136","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1614183,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kym Stys","original_name":"Kym Stys","popularity":4.777,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"5e05d94e9bcd0f00150df796","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":59444,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Edward R.
