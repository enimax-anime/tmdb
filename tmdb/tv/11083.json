Samson is informed by one of the villagers that once, long ago, an evil witch doctor was sentenced to death by the villagers and, before jumping into the volcano, he cursed the village, saying his spirit would return to avenge him. Ever since that day, at the same time every year, a giant green lizard-looking animal comes and destroys the village. This is deemed to be the spirit of the witch doctor carrying out his curseâ€”a.k.a. the curse of Monatabu. Samson decides to investigate this with Goliath.","production_code":"","runtime":9,"season_number":1,"show_id":11083,"still_path":"/uvL7Yr9ovxK2ZGBEz7q5ylVLSmW.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"6482aa6cd2b20900ebbf7ca4","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":13620,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"William
