Small wonder, then, that God's disappointed and considering destroying the whole thing. But he has a soft spot for his failed experiment and decides to give it one last shot: If he can find one person to convince him the universe is worth saving, he will. Just like that. And being a sporting deity, he lets the Devil chose, and so he does: Bob Alman, an autoworker whose goal in life seems to be to just sliding through. And never has there been a more unlikely, or more reluctant, person for the job. Fear convinces Bob to accept the mission, but God's vague instructions are no help. And the Devil, who figures he only has one soul to focus on now, is a formidable obstacle. On the job or at home with his family, Bob is forever changed.
