A second series of Mongrels began airing on 7 November 2011.\n\nThe series revolves around the lives of five anthropomorphic animals who hang around the back of a pub in Millwall, the Isle of Dogs, London. The characters are Nelson, a metrosexual fox; Destiny, an Afghan hound; Marion, a \"borderline-retarded\" cat; Kali, a grudge-bearing pigeon; and Vince, Nelson's friend, a sociopathic foul-mouthed fox.\n\nThe show is aimed at an adult audience, features \"neutering, incontinence, cannibalism and catnip overdoses\" and humour styles such as slapstick and farce. For example, the first episode begins with a scene in which Marion, portrayed as desperately trying to revive his deceased owner, learns she has actually been dead for four months, whereupon he casually gives his cat friends permission to eat her. Mongrels has attracted accusations of plagiarism, with claims that Mongrels stole ideas from a similar Channel 4 show called Pets.","popularity":7.457,"poster_path":"/42uzy4tRF3CHhqkE56zo9rcMBTk.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":3324,"logo_path":"/dqT3yOTlfJRmtvk52Ccd1O6dZ0A.png","name":"BBC","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2010-08-11","episode_count":3,"id":44255,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2010-06-22","episode_count":8,"id":44256,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":10},{"air_date":"2011-11-07","episode_count":9,"id":44257,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":10}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.9,"vote_count":16,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258a73f760ee346616b020e","air_date":"2010-06-22","episodes":[{"air_date":"2010-06-22","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":773348,"name":"Nelson the Online Predator","overview":"Nelson uses Toby Anstis's social networking login to set up a blind date with a human.
