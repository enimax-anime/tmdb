Then, the teams use their chef bucks to purchase a basket of ingredients for the last skill drill cook. It's a head-to-head battle between the final four recruits as they each cook a composed dish to earn a spot in the final cook. Anne Burrell and Tiffany Derry work closely with their final recruits practicing their three-course, restaurant quality meal, but a surprise special guest pops in and reveals a twist. In the end, judges Matt Abdoo, Andrienne Cheatham and Michael Jenkins taste the recruits' dishes in a blind taste test to determine the winner of the $25,000 prize.",
