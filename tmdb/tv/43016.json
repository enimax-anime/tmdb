The Hatfield-McCoy saga begins with Devil Anse Hatfield and Randall McCoy.. Close friends and comrades until near the end of the Civil War, they return to their neighboring homes—Hatfield in West Virginia, McCoy just across the Tug River border in Kentucky—to increasing tensions, misunderstandings and resentments that soon explode into all-out warfare between their families. As hostilities grow, friends, neighbors and outside forces join the fight, bringing the two states to the brink of another civil war.","popularity":15.937,"poster_path":"/20sdSd2UxKb6286zA87aufliu9M.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":11073,"logo_path":"/aCbASRcI1MI7DXjPbSW9Fcv9uGR.png","name":"Sony Pictures Television Studios","origin_country":"US"},{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2012-05-28","episode_count":3,"id":52477,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/fPoUoQ7epbUkpCwzW1bkWswVAXp.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"Never Forgive.
