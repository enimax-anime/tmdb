The program focuses on the firsthand experiences of twelve American service members during World War II, including an Army nurse, a member of the Tuskegee Airmen, a second generation Japanese American and prisoner of war, and an Austrian Jewish immigrant. The twelve members recorded their time in both theaters and some had later interviews; found footage from the battlefield was paired with the stories of the twelve service members.\n\nThe episodes premiered on five consecutive days, with two episodes per day. The series is narrated by Gary Sinise and was produced by Lou Reda Productions in Easton, Pennsylvania, United States.","popularity":14.133,"poster_path":"/zWODdVZ3nmZejpaxDxoWn4io9kt.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":25505,"logo_path":null,"name":"Lou Reda Productions","origin_country":""},{"id":3507,"logo_path":"/m7iLIC5UfC2Pp60bkjXMWLFrmp6.png","name":"History","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2010-11-10","episode_count":5,"id":43624,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2009-11-15","episode_count":10,"id":43623,"name":"Season 1","overview":"Seventy years in the making.
