It originally aired between 1990 and 1994.\n\nIn the pilot episode Detective Inspector Alleyn was played by Simon Williams. William Simons played Alleyn's righthand man and \"Watson\" figure, Detective Sergeant Fox, and Belinda Lang starred as the painter Agatha Troy, Alleyn's love interest.\n\nWilliams was unavailable when the first series was made, so whilst Simons and Lang reprised their original roles, the lead character was henceforth played by Patrick Malahide.\n\nThe BBC made nine episodes in all, each based on a separate novel. The eight episodes featuring Malahide are available on DVD in the USA and UK. An Australian set has all nine episodes.","popularity":4.694,"poster_path":"/fF0XU1o2hYULRVIkUjdxdDBXRsm.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1990-12-23","episode_count":1,"id":30779,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1993-04-18","episode_count":5,"id":30780,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1994-01-10","episode_count":3,"id":30778,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":4,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52586463760ee34661161cd4","air_date":"1993-04-18","episodes":[{"air_date":"1993-04-18","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":589627,"name":"A Man Lay Dead","overview":"Alleyn cancels his holiday with Troy to investigate a murder connected to a stolen chalice, but he's called when a second murder occurs at uncle's estate.","production_code":"","runtime":97,"season_number":1,"show_id":20767,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1993-04-25","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":589628,"name":"The Nursing Home Murder","overview":"A member of Parliament who has taken controversial stands on Palestine and A-bomb development is murdered during a routine appendectomy.","production_code":"","runtime":97,"season_number":1,"show_id":20767,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1993-05-02","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1451385,"name":"Final Curtain","overview":"An egotistical Shakespearean ham actor gathers his dysfunctional extended family in his mansion on his 75th birthday for the reading of his will.","production_code":"","runtime":97,"season_number":1,"show_id":20767,"still_path":"/kxZ8bXz6dGIN8o4wXNICUqbyqe5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1993-05-09","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":589629,"name":"Death at the Bar","overview":"During a display of dart throwing in a Cornish pub a man's hand is impaled by a dart, and he dies shortly afterward from cyanide although no one can explain how.","production_code":"","runtime":97,"season_number":1,"show_id":20767,"still_path":"/8tdFQdTHckG84tIJ2JR3qGvZATx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1993-05-16","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"finale","id":589630,"name":"Death in a White Tie","overview":"Inspector Alleyn enlists the help of his friend Lord Robert \"Bunchy\" Gospell to uncover a society blackmailer.
