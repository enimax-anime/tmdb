Always in House's way is Dr. Lisa Cuddy, the Dean of Medicine  and hospital administrator — and ethical gatekeeper of the hospital who  is in constant conflict with House over his extreme treatments and  unconventional behavior. House's former love Stacy Warner recently  accepted a job as General Counsel to the hospital, and her presence  there has reignited feelings House thought were safely buried.","poster_path":"/j2LxTsMhXYqfi4k9Vome8kQc26U.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":7.5},{"air_date":"2006-09-05","episode_count":24,"id":3679,"name":"Season 3","overview":"In the Season 2 finale, House suffered  multiple gunshot wounds inflicted by a former patient's husband  determined to carry out retribution for House's treatment of his wife's  case.

As each of  them dealt with the aftermath of the break-up, House got married to an  immigrant in need of a Green Card. In the series' milestone 150th  episode, Thirteen was released from prison after euthanizing her brother  who was suffering from the late stages of Huntington's Disease, the  same disease with which she is afflicted.  As the season comes to a  close, when House's attempts to mend his relationship with Cuddy fall  short, he's compelled to take drastic and possibly irrevocable measures  that could forever change the course of their relationship.","id":3681,"poster_path":"/fqMpdjiGe4jejxTm1NAWnhRV6CM.jpg","season_number":8,"vote_average":7.7}}}
