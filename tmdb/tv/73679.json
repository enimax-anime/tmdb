In the city of Takasaki, north of Tokyo, Amir Takahashi runs a popular bakery. Born in Iran, he moved to Japan at 20 to master the baker's art. Amir spares no effort: he fetches water from a mountain spring, makes his own soymilk from local beans, and uses only additive-free, natural ingredients. The results are both wholesome and delicious.",

Fascinated with the samurai from an early age, New Yorker Andrew Mancabelli chose a career as an armorsmith in Japan. But there is little demand nowadays for traditional armor, and for a relative novice like Mancabelli, it can be hard to make ends meet. We meet a man overcoming various obstacles in pursuit of his dream to be a Japanese armorsmith.",

Sakai has been known for bladesmithing since the Muromachi period (1333–1568), The emergence of sushi as the fast food of the age called for a range of knives for street-side vendors. The bonsai tradition, meanwhile, spawned a range of delicate shears and squeeze-scissors, a genre of tool that was also turned to the shaping of wagashi confections for the tea ceremony, and the fashion and beauty needs of an increasingly style-conscious populace. Indeed, this is the area of Japanese bladesmithing that continues to evolve.",

For those who work in the area, the rise and fall of new businesses is part of the fabric of everyday life. Yet the average lifespan of a business in Japan is considerably longer than in most countries: roughly 30 years compared to 18 or so in the US. Contributing to this statistic is Japan’s abundance of long-established businesses. So many of these companies exist that there is a special word for them: shinise. Japan has around 26 thousand companies with a century or more of history. Of these, more than a thousand have passed the bicentenary mark, and a handful have battled through for a staggering thousand years or longer. What are the secrets of Japan's many centuries-old firms? Peter Barakan meets with expert Yoshihiko Takubo, while Matt Alt visits Nihonbashi, the old heart of Tokyo, guided by shinise expert Haruki Kawasaki.",

An excursion with his Japanese-school classmates when he was 20 was to change his destiny forever. On that trip to a soba restaurant, Chowdhury was intrigued by what his teacher described as healthy Japanese food. And when he tried a simple morisoba set combining plain, cold soba noodles with a tsuyu dipping sauce, he was blown away by the taste. In this Japanophiles interview with Peter Barakan, Rezaul Karim Chowdhury talks about his struggle to master the making of soba noodles.",

The continued growth of Tokyo’s population has necessitated constant additions and revisions to its infrastructure—and the city’s importance as Japan’s political, financial and cultural capital means those additions and revisions must be carried out without interrupting its daily flow.

A special sauce is brushed on top to complete this Japanese soul food. Hiroshima is a place people all over Japan associate with good okonomiyaki. Because of this, competition is fierce, but Lopez's restaurant is one of the most popular in town, and one menu item in particular features a spicy twist.",

Japan's wholehearted embrace of online shopping is fueled, in part, thanks to the country's efficient shipping infrastructure, in which next-day delivery is the norm.",

On this edition of Japanology Plus, we learn how population centers like Sapporo deal with all that white stuff, and the challenges that lie ahead for Japan's snowiest regions.",

But while trains and subways still enjoy healthy ridership in Japan's urban centers, regional rail is another story. Competing forms of transportation like cars, buses, and airplanes, plus Japan's shrinking population—and concentration of the population in major cities—means regional rail lines are facing a crisis. We dive into the details of that crisis, and what rail companies are doing to combat it, on this edition of Japanology Plus.",

Whether it's capsule toys, model trains, dioramas, or more, the country has a knack for extremely detailed, picture-perfect scaled-down representations of reality. How—and why—so much attention is paid to miniaturized detail, and what connection the love of miniatures has to Japanese society at large, is the theme of this edition of Japanology Plus.",

This time on Japanology Plus, we look at Japan's rapid industrial growth, both in the 19th century and again after the devastation of the Second World War.",

Traditionally, one alternative name for Japan is mizuho no kuni, or “the Land of Abundant Rice.” As we learn on this edition of Japanology Plus, when society shifted from hunting and gathering to agriculture during the Yayoi period, communities formed around rice paddies to facilitate the cooperation necessary for bringing in a plentiful harvest. This organizational structure laid a foundation for Japanese society, and the effects can still be seen in Japan’s cultural identity and people’s shared beliefs today.",

Located 1,000 kilometers off Japan's Pacific coast, the Ogasawara Islands were first settled by a group of Westerners and South Pacific Islanders, who interacted with later Japanese settlers to bring forth a unique culture. Our expert guide is Sho Sebori, a direct descendant of the American who became the leader of the first community on the islands.",

We hear how he became known as a founding father of the largest Indian community in Japan. Through his story, we get an insight into the experience of moving to Japan from abroad and the culture that immigrants bring with them. Chandrani has spent almost all his life in Japan in Nishi-kasai, a commuter town on the eastern tip of Tokyo. When he arrived, it was covered in farmland and didn't even have a train station. It has since undergone massive urban development and is now known to some as \"Little India.\"",

In a series called Tokyo Stories, Peter Barakan meets residents not originally from Japan, to hear how their lives have been affected. This time he speaks with Mateusz Urbanowicz, from Poland. He paints scenes from the city, such as the colorful storefronts of independent shops, and rainy, neon-lit nightscapes. He explains his view of Tokyo's urban development.",

This time, our theme is Emergency Goods. Our main guest, disaster mitigation advisor Kunizaki Nobue, introduces various useful items, and explains how Japan prepares for future catastrophes.",

                    "overview": "We explore Amami Oshima, a subtropical paradise, through the stunning art of Tanaka Isson. Sometimes referred to as \"the Japanese Gauguin,\" Isson found new inspiration after moving to this southern island. While his work was not appreciated during his lifetime, today it is frequently featured in exhibitions around Japan. In the first of two episodes about Amami Oshima, Peter Barakan follows in Isson's footsteps, and discovers why his work has become so enduringly popular.",
