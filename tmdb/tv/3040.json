DeMott, alongside Big, narrowed the field of 75 hopefuls down to 13 cast members.  This year, rather than throwing the extravagant casting gala, Tough Enough chose to make the Casting Special more intimate. Judges spent more time evaluating the hopefuls as people. Once they saw what they liked, they selected 25 finalists to go through a torturous several days of training, both in and out of the ring. Some of the 25 didn't make it to the end. The ones who did were there to hear the final 13 names called:\n\nChad - Jamie - Nick - Jill - John - Jonah - Eric - Justin - Kelly Matt - Lisa - Scott - Rebekah","production_code":"","runtime":42,"season_number":3,"show_id":3040,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Tazz","credit_id":"558729f5c3a368273b0061f0","order":14,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":569184,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Peter Senerchia","original_name":"Peter Senerchia","popularity":4.588,"profile_path":"/tZ2RvEa08ZVsEVr85zkNIVrKxra.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"52574b8e19c29531db0ae84a","order":35,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":230382,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Daniel Puder","original_name":"Daniel Puder","popularity":0.694,"profile_path":"/tKPK2Iqv4inTZOH8fO34acJw2SD.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"635b5b62894ed6007dea2737","order":508,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1061603,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Kevin Dunn","original_name":"Kevin Dunn","popularity":4.769,"profile_path":"/nlO9mosiRuv6I0iIEsBj6fw5UHD.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"635b5b8595c0af0098f67656","order":509,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3761115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John \"Big\" Gaburick","original_name":"John \"Big\" Gaburick","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"635b63e6b3316b0081fa3971","order":516,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":2048164,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Beth Holmes","original_name":"Beth Holmes","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"635f56d8211ce50081a09af1","order":536,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":543521,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jim Ross","original_name":"Jim Ross","popularity":3.485,"profile_path":"/ufuTblMtz0xBknpRIQm1k0U6Qf5.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"6363388f85867800828a39f1","order":561,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":237743,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Melina Perez","original_name":"Melina Perez","popularity":2.258,"profile_path":"/1AYEwR1c6Qr6BUGlVcF8GbeeWlx.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"636338b007e2810082974d83","order":562,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":217278,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dara Daivari","original_name":"Dara Daivari","popularity":2.112,"profile_path":"/p9V66wBqtoY80x2FWsenc0ZHh4W.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2002-10-24","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":230347,"name":"This Is Not a Game Show","overview":"Last week on Tough Enough, the 13 members of the cast were chosen after a long and strenuous tryout process. As this week's show kicked off, Big told the cast members that their challenges were not done yet. He then pointed to a gigantic mountain-side house and told them they had to run to it because it was where they would be living.\n\nEven before everybody settled in, the drama of season three began. Apparently, Scott rubbed everybody the wrong way right from the start, especially his roommate Jamie. Before Jamie was even unpacked, Scott asked her if she was a lesbian. Jamie was clearly not excited about the question.\n\nScott's insane comments intensified as the show went on. His most offensive comment to the house members came when he asked if there were a lot of fags in a certain location.","production_code":"","runtime":21,"season_number":3,"show_id":3040,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Self","credit_id":"635b5b8595c0af0098f67656","order":509,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3761115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John \"Big\" Gaburick","original_name":"John \"Big\" Gaburick","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":"2002-10-31","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":230358,"name":"Jonah Makes Impression","overview":"Like last week, Scott managed to annoy everybody in the house on this week's episode of Tough Enough. His biggest target was Jamie. On top of calling her and a few of the guys in the house faggots, he also asked her a very personal question -- \"\"have you ever used a female condom?\"\"\n\nIt was later learned that Jamie's dislike for Scott comes from when he saw her naked. Apparently, Scott just barged into the bathroom without knocking when Jamie was getting into the shower.\n\nScott also managed to get on Eric and Jonah's nerves. The two guys made a bet with him, stating that if he was able to score a girl's phone number while out on the town, they would go to the beach the next day in bikinis. If he failed, however, Scott would have to do the act. Unfortunately for Eric and Jonah, Scott was able to pull two phone numbers. Eric and Jonah tried to talk their way out of the bet, but Scott wasn't budging.","production_code":"","runtime":21,"season_number":3,"show_id":3040,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Self","credit_id":"635b5b8595c0af0098f67656","order":509,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3761115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John \"Big\" Gaburick","original_name":"John \"Big\" Gaburick","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":"2002-11-07","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":230357,"name":"The Meat of Competition","overview":"For the first time this season, Al Snow, Bill DeMott, Ivory and Big made a cut, sending the 6' 10\"\" Chad back home to Wisconsin. According to the trainers, as well as some of the cast members, Chad just wasn't picking up the in-ring work. Plus, his charisma was lacking. As a result, Chad was cut, leaving only 10 Tough Enough contestants.\n\nAs usual, Scott found himself getting into some trouble this week on Tough Enough. In addition to engaging in an ethnic/religious war with Rebekah, he also had a few too many drinks during the cast's night out. In fact, Scott had so many drinks, that an ambulance was called. Near lifeless, Scott rested in a puddle of his own urine as EMTs attempted to help him. Luckily while at the hospital, Scott received the attention he needed.

Dreamer was the first to show, making an emotional speech right from the start. His words were so moving that many of the cast members were brought to tears. In fact, Dreamer himself was choked up, as well. According to Dreamer, his father is suffering from Parkinson's Disease. Unfortunately, the disease has taken his father's eyesight. An operation restored his eyesight, however, only for two weeks. It was during those two weeks that Tommy Dreamer debuted on WWE television. Having his father witness his debut meant the world to Tommy. Not long after, his father once again lost his sight.  Rey Mysterio's appearance was a lot less emotional, but equally informative. Rey talked to the cast about his training and coming up in Mexico City. He told them how important masks were to the people in Mexico. Then, in the ultimate sign of respect, Mysterio removed his mask, showing his face to the cast.","production_code":"","runtime":21,"season_number":3,"show_id":3040,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Self","credit_id":"635b5b8595c0af0098f67656","order":509,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3761115,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John \"Big\" Gaburick","original_name":"John \"Big\" Gaburick","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Tommy Dreamer","credit_id":"636366dbecbde9007aa51d9a","order":563,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1056699,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tom Laughlin","original_name":"Tom Laughlin","popularity":1.977,"profile_path":"/lNXvXZ7Wh4ys3mLPqbgxb1nINhs.jpg"},{"character":"Rey Mysterio","credit_id":"636366e55ca7040091ecdfad","order":564,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":568555,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Óscar Gutiérrez","original_name":"Óscar Gutiérrez","popularity":2.589,"profile_path":"/b3ixP7BaQNifCGbfKkHU823TjiD.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2002-11-21","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":230362,"name":"Learning to Adapt","overview":"The Tough Enough 3 cast grew smaller this week while a few of the competitors expressed their desire to become more than just friends with their housemates.\n\nJamie loves flirting with the guys in the house, especially John.

While at the hospital, however, it was learned that Jonah's injuries were not as severe as first thought and that he would be alright with a little medication.\n\nBeing the opportunist that he is, Jonah decided that this was the perfect opportunity to play a rib on his cast mates. Wrapped in head bandages and secured by a neck brace, Jonah walked into Trax West and asked everybody to sit around him.

Reality hits the remaining 13 that the stakes are high as they compete to become the next WWE Superstar.\n\nThe next day at the training center, Steve Austin introduces courage as the theme for this week's challenges. If the contestants are afraid to get hurt and take risks, they'll have no chance in the WWE. Trish Stratus puts Matt, a ten-year pro, through a personality drill. She's so impressed with him, she sends him to the ring for an exhibition match with the cocky but capable Luke. But Matt fades into the background as Luke takes total control of the match and shines instead.\n\nRyan struggles during training, incurring the wrath of Bill DeMott who likes nothing about \"Skidmarks.\" Miss USA Rima gets a real culture shock when she takes her first hard bumps and body slams in the ring.\n\nJohn Cena, the top WWE Superstar in the world, arrives to watch training and give advice about how to succeed in the business.\n\nOutside of training, Luke forms a fast friendship with southern livewire Jeremiah. The drunken antics of their bromance lightens the mood and entertains their fellow housemates. On the other side of the equation, Ryan and Mike won't ever be friends. Thinking Ryan is too nice and soft, Mike kicks off their feud by teasing him about writing letters to his girlfriend.\n\nThe next day, Steve Austin really puts the courage of the contestants to the test when he brings them outside to try to outrun police attack dogs. Steve and Bill take great pleasure in watching the cast get taken down one by one. But it's Miss USA Rima and big Andy who take the hardest hits when the trained dogs bite into their protective gear. Surprisingly, Eric excels at the challenge, singing and skipping to the finish line as a dog tries to bite through the protective gear.\n\nMiss USA Rima is 20 minutes late for to the skills challenge, raising red flags about her commitment for the trainers. In the skills challenge, the contestants' courage is pushed to the limits. They will be squashed in the corner and then body slammed 5 times by the 300 pounds plus Bill. It's an agonizing and bruising exercise that shows how physically demanding the business is.\n\nAfter deliberating on the best and worst, Steve announces the Bottom Three � Ryan, Rima and, the veteran Matt.\n\nIn the ring, Steve Austin grills Rima about her lateness but concedes her mental toughness. While Ryan might be too nice for the business it's Matt saying that he's \"waiting for his moment\" that seals his fate.

Mickael, in particular, is furious that Ryan would outlast a veteran like Matt.\n\nThe next morning Bill sends the contestants on a grueling run that clearly separates the weak from the strong. Luke comes in first, Rima beats all of the girls and even some of the boys, Michelle's body starts to fail her, and Eric's poor physical condition puts him in last place.\n\nWith no time to recover, the contestants are sent to the gym for a hardcore training session. In Trish's group Michelle continues to struggle, and it's obvious that her head is not in the game. In Bill's group Mickael shows sloppy technique and is sent back to work with the beginners.\n\nSteve rewards rising star Luke by locking up with him in the ring. Luke is on cloud nine as everyone looks on with jealousy. Special guest, Big Show, makes a surprise visit to the gym and watches the kids at work. He singles out Eric for a chat, expressing disappointment in his lack of conditioning. Later that night Michelle calls home and has a meltdown when she learns her daughter isn't there, and it's clear the contest is starting to wear on her.\n\nOn day two as the contestants warm up, Steve enters to announce the life lesson. But Michelle interrupts and announces she's quitting! Her daughter is more important to her than the competition – a decision Steve says he respects.\n\nOut on the field, the rest of the contestants take on a new Life Lesson – learn a cheerleading drill AND perform it at Universal City Walk! Trish brings in former WWE diva and NFL cheerleader Stacy Keibler to help coach the contestants. A toothless Jeremiah steals the show, while Rima continues to struggle, taking an embarrassing fall in front of the crowd.\n\nOn day three it's time for the Skills Challenge: Chain of Command. Before they begin, Rima approaches Bill and asks for some one-on-one training time, to which he agrees. Steve sets up the challenge, and after each round people will be cut based on poor technique until only one remains. Rima and Mickael are cut in the first round, and shockingly Luke is cut in the second. In round three Ryan falls back on the hokey schtick he's been warned about, which results in him being booted. Martin and Eric, who has made an incredible turnaround since his talk with Big Show, steal the trainers respect when they are the last two standing.\n\nBut it is Martin who is declared the winner, emerging as a new contender against Luke.\n\nSteve and the trainers announce the bottom three – Ryan, Rima and Mickael.\n\nBack at the house Rima is furious, and Mickael is beyond pissed that he has been lumped in the same category as Ryan. In frustration, he strips Ryan's bed saying he won't need it since he'll be the one going home tonight.\n\nAt the elimination, Steve is impressed that Rima asked for one-on-one help. Steve promises her she will get it, and soon, sending her back to the house to get ready. Steve pits rivals Ryan and Mickael against each other in a promo duel. Mickael simply sounds desperate while Ryan finally shows some fire, and Steve sends a stunned Mickael home.","production_code":"","runtime":42,"season_number":5,"show_id":3040,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-04-25","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":230430,"name":"110 Pound Elephant in the Room","overview":"After Steve dismisses her from elimination, Rima returns to the house to tell the other contestants that Ryan and his rival Mickael are still in the ring, fighting it out in a promo duel. When Ryan (AKA \"Skidmark\") walks in, the group is stunned that he has survived yet another elimination.\n\nLater that night, Rima gets what she asked for – a one-on-one midnight training session with Bill. However, it turns out to be more than she bargained for as Bill puts her through a grueling workout that exposes her lack of training. Rima is pushed to the breaking point but tearfully tells Bill that she doesn't want to quit. Bill offers encouragement, but Rima goes back to the house bruised and shaken.\n\nThe next day at the training center, \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin introduces the theme of agility. To bring the point home, he introduces his favorite opponent and WWE Legend, Bret \"The Hitman\" Hart. The Cast is in awe listening to the words of a season veteran.\n\nTraining that day is a series of leaps over the top rope of the ring. The entire cast fumbles miserably with the drill, except for Luke and Jeremiah. While Luke isn't surprised that he and Jeremiah did so well, the coaches are surprised that the rest of the cast did so poorly. They have an uphill battle to learn the lesson of agility.\n\nThe next day, Bill wakes up the house and sends them to meet Trish. They arrive at Friscoe's, a 50's style dinner and are told that they will be working as waiters and waitresses all day – on roller-skates. While many of the guys, especially 6'6\" Eric, fumble and fall as they try to learn to skate, it's Rima who excels at this life lesson. She zips around successfully serving customers and perhaps improving her chances for staying.\n\nAfter a long day on the skates, the cast is treated to free drinks and the party gets rowdy as Luke and Jeremiah put on a show on the dance floor. Meanwhile, Andy sits quietly in the corner keeping a promise to his family to stay straight edge and focused throughout the competition.\n\nAt the Skills Challenge the next day, the cast is given a sequence of moves to perform to test their agility. If they cannot perform well, they'll be eliminated from the challenge. First up is Rima who still hasn't grasped the most rudimentary of maneuvers and is thrown out of the ring by Bill. The rest of the cast shows various stages of improvement and it comes down to Andy, Martin and Luke. Andy is frustrated when he is next out, wondering what he has to do to break into the top ranks. Once again, Martin outshines Luke in the final round and wins the challenge. Arrogant Luke thinks the trainers are playing mind games with him and won't even shake Martin's hand.\n\n\"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin takes the trainers into deliberate the final three. While there were some standouts like Martin, there are some big disappointments – including the \"110 pound elephant in the room.\"\n\nSteve Austin returns to announce the bottom three. He calls Rima's name then tells her he's not going to call anyone else. The shocked cast looks on as he eliminates Rima on the spot. She pleads her case but Austin's mind is made up.\n\nA dejected Rima heads back to the house to pack up her bags. After saying goodbye, she brings Steve Austin her Tough Enough belt. Despite her drawbacks in the ring, Austin tells her that there are other ways to break into the business and she may still have a bright future. After a Stone Cold hug, Rima leaves disappointed – but not defeated.","production_code":"","runtime":42,"season_number":5,"show_id":3040,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-05-02","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":230431,"name":"Don't Take My Kindness for Weakness","overview":"The contestants are in for a rude awakening when Bill, Trish and Booker T storm into the house blasting an air horn and yelling for the contestants to meet them on the field. The group is greeted with an obstacle course that is about to become their worst enemy. While Jeremiah does well, everyone else struggles to complete the course. Ivelisse, in particular, is at the point of quitting, but with Martin's help, she finishes the task.\n\nAfterwards, the contestants go straight into their daily training where they meet special guest Rey Mysterio who talks to them about teamwork. Then the trainers put the contestants through a grueling workout session. First up, bag slams. Ryan is immediately kicked out of the ring for tripping on his way in, and things only get worse from there. He is kicked out again for botching a leapfrog drill. But he isn't the only one to struggle with this drill. Christina mis-times her jump and crashes into Ivelisse who suffers a bad leg sprain.\n\nThe next morning, Trish stops by the house to talk to Christina and Ivelisse. They are the last two females in the contest, but they are looking like the weaker sex. Injured or not, Trish warns them that if they don�t step it up, it could be the end of the line. Ivelisse vows that over her dead body will Christina be allowed to injure her then become the last girl standing.\n\nFor the life lesson, contestants arrive at a gym where they�re met with a special guest, former NBA star John Salley, who�s brought along some friends to help with teamwork - a world-ranked basketball team of dwarves! The Tough Enough kids are awful and are quickly trounced by the pint-sized players.\n\nDay three it�s skills challenge time. Booker T expresses his disappointment in the contestants� lack of teamwork the previous day, and singles out an eye-rolling Ryan for an especially angry tirade. Steve and Bill announce the challenge: a series of sequences called Three's A Crowd, and they begin. The trainers express disappointment in Luke, who seems to be coasting. Martin and AJ make it to the final round - as does Ryan, much to the surprise of the trainers. It's Ryan's shot at redemption, but he fails miserably and Martin is declared the winner of his third skills challenge in a row.\n\nAfter deliberation, Steve and the trainers announce the bottom three - Christina, Ryan and, shockingly, Luke!\n\nBack at the house Andy gives Christina a pep talk on getting through elimination, while Ryan takes it like a trooper. Luke, on the other hand, seethes with frustration and dares anyone to give him a good reason for his being in the bottom three.\n\nAt the elimination, the bottom three face off with Steve who says it�s about to be a bad day for somebody. Steve admonishes Christina for not impressing him, then turns his wrath on Luke, asking why Martin is kicking his ass every week. Additionally, he says he doesn�t like his attitude or his arrogance. Steve wonders if Ryan is unteachable and thick-headed for having continuously ignored the trainers� advice to stop it with his hokey antics. Ryan declares he�s getting better, but unfortunately for him, it�s three strikes and you�re out.

And while Jeremiah is happy to see best-bud Luke, Ivelesse is not pleased to see Christina, who was the cause of her injury. Rattled by what \"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin said to her in elimination, Christina has doubts about her position in the competition.\n\nAt training, the contestants are faced with possibly the hardest session to date and everyone takes a beating. When Eric predictably stumbles, Bill and Booker are there to harp on his appalling condition. But even Jeremiah, whose athletically ability has been unrivaled, struggles.\n\nWith the theme of the week being focus, Steve Austin reiterates how important it is to stay focused on the task at hand because \"if your mind is somewhere, you're probably going to screw things up.\" These turn out to be important words of advice since training is about to advance to working on top of the ropes. Cocky as ever, a reckless Jeremiah jumps the gun and despite having no experience, insists on wanting to take a jump from the top rope. Steve, seeing the potential danger, has no problem reining him in for his own, and others, safety.\n\nChristina digs deep and makes a huge comeback in training, impressing the trainers with her fortitude in the ring. Meanwhile, her rival Ivelisse is clearly struggling as her leg injury continues to worsen and by the end of training Bill and Booker find her questioning her ability to continue.\n\nAt the weekly life lesson, the contestants are forced to use their focus once again when they have to navigate their way around a treacherous ropes course. To help motivate and support them, Steve Austin brings in special guest John Morrison. When Ivelesse's injury threatens to take her out of the game altogether, Morrison becomes instrumental in coaching her through the course.\n\nWhile most contestants complete the course with relative ease, it's a rough day for Eric whose body completely gives out on him. Stuck on the ropes, he flounders like a cat caught in the blinds. To add insult to injury, Christina not only passes him up but steps on him in the process. Determined not to quit, Eric tries to soldier on until Steve eventually has no choice but to call time. A dejected Eric is hoisted to the ground while his fate in the competition hangs in the balance.\n\nIn the skills challenge, the contestants are forced to use every bit of focus when they are asked to balance on the top four corners of the ring. Unable to even stand, AJ takes a tumble making it one of the worst performances of the day, closely followed by Andy and Eric. For those who didn't fall, the challenge gets harder � balancing while big cats Eric and Andy run the ropes.\n\nIvelisse holds on just long enough to beat Christina but by the end it is down to Jeremiah and Luke to be the last men standing. Their challenge is to go head to head in a drill from training involving elbow drops from the ropes. Finally, Jeremiah's greenness catches up to him and he slams the dummy the wrong way. Although he tries to save the mistake with a crazy aerial maneuver it's too late and the win goes to Luke.\n\nAfter deliberating on the best and worst, Steve announces the bottom three: Eric, Ivelisse and AJ\n\nBack at the house the talk turns to elimination.
