During the Roadkill Project Car Update presented by Dickies, Freiburger and Finnegan prepare for the ultimate cross-country road trip in Finnegan's Hemi-powered Bel Air Gasser with the installation of an Aeromotive Stealth fuel tank and fuel system. The install offers tips on assembling soft and hard fuel lines, relay wiring, and gives a closer look at this righteous street/strip car. Finally, the guys answer viewer questions about the cars, the show, and their personal lives before getting an in-depth look at custom piston design from Bryan Moreland, Engineering Manager at CP-Carrillo.",

Finally, Freiburger tests Duplicolor's Vinyl and Fabric Coating, a spray-on dye for restoring interior parts.

From flip-top gas caps to old-school friction shocks, Kirk creates parts that turn vintage iron into period-correct hot rods under his Crafty-B moniker. Finnegan also drives the infamous Roadkill '69 El Camino to Camarillo airfield to find out how badly the factory brakes perform and then Wilwood Brakes gives the Elco a serious binder upgrade. The Elco is fitted with 11-inch disc brakes at all four-corners and tested to see how much the stopping distance is affected. Next a monster set of 14-inch discs and six-piston calipers are swapped onto the car for the ultimate brake upgrade. How well do the new parts work? Stay tuned and find out!

The fenderless version of the Muscle Truck was fun but it’s high time we restore the truck to her former glory. We’ll replace the rapidly deteriorating particle board bed floor with new oak slats and bolt-on a new pair of aftermarket front fenders. We’ll also add a bit of functionality to the truck by covering the massive step notch in the rear frame rails with sheet metal, which will keep stuff from falling out of the bed.",

Once the LeMans is sorted we work on our 1973 Chevy Ramp Truck during a Dickies Roadkill Project Car Update.

He also re-geared the 9-inch rear end, changed the transmission from a 4L65E to a 4L80E, and swapped converters. Off the bottle, the car slowed down from its previous best pass of 10.03 seconds, but with the go-button in play the car ran a respectable 9.94 ET. Finnegan also dropped by the garage for a new Q –and-A session and we’ve got a brand new quick tip from the staff of Lincoln Tech.",

On this episode of Hot Rod Garage Presented by Lincoln Tech, the crew tunes the FAST XFI 2.0 electronic fuel injection system for wide-open throttle performance, lowers the front suspension, adds a pair of Viking adjustable dampers, and installs a Hurst Roll Control line lock for better burnouts. Then Finnegan takes to the drag strip to find out how well the car performs on the same wore-out pair of Firestone Cheater Slicks that he drove cross-country on. In the Q & A session, Freiburger and Finnegan discuss vintage Mustang Sportroofs, old Roadkill project cars, the F-Bomb Camaro, and of course, the staff of Motor Trend.",

Also, the trip to Colorado and building the Cummins powered Cadillac (bro-hammer) in the junkyard was a lot of fun, however that wasn't HRG. More recently I enjoyed building the Crownhick in ep. 49 especially after hours completing the job off camera and of course I was forced to drive it around for a week or so just to make sure everything was working. But, if I really had to pick, I'm guessing my favorite would be between ep. 44 the Fury Road master episode - taking a family station wagon and turning it into a fun driver, and episode 35 - mini tubbing my 66 Chevelle...... Yeah, ok, that's the one I'm going with, Ep 35. Hanging out with friends and working on my own car is pretty much the perfect way to spend the week. Yours Truly....... Lucky”",
