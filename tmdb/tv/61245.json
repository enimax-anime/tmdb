Mary arrives at the isolated Jamaica Inn to discover her Aunt is a shell of the carefree woman she remembers from her childhood, and instead finds a drudge who is firmly under the spell of her domineering husband Joss. The Inn has no guests - the rooms are locked and kept for storage - but it soon becomes clear that it’s a cover, as Joss is the leader of a smuggling ring, and Jamaica Inn the hub of his ‘free’ trade.","popularity":7.972,"poster_path":"/45oapNmPdruvofEFWXl9MJIgwIy.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":8088,"logo_path":"/ztpISLBYYRBJXFD3wo2o1TFuJ3Z.png","name":"Origin Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2014-04-21","episode_count":3,"id":62413,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":6.8}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Miniseries","vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":21,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"53fce17b0e0a267a7800aec9","air_date":"2014-04-21","episodes":[{"air_date":"2014-04-21","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1005187,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"Mary moves in with her Aunt when her mother passes away, avoiding her marriage to local boy Ned.
