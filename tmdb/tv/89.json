The series was created by its star, Christopher Titus, Jack Kenny, and Brian Hargrove. This sitcom was based on Christopher's stand-up comedy act, more specifically his one-man show Norman Rockwell is Bleeding, which was based loosely upon his real-life family; lines from Norman Rockwell is Bleeding were spoken by Titus as commentary. Titus plays an outwardly childish adult, who owns a custom car shop. The show follows him and his dimwitted halfbrother Dave, his girlfriend Erin with the \"heart of gold\", his goody-goody friend Tommy, and his arrogantly lewd, bigoted and multiple-divorced father Ken \"Papa\" Titus.","popularity":66.297,"poster_path":"/Ab7WWSBFSYbZVXORydeEaPltG9K.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":2,"id":257,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2000-03-20","episode_count":9,"id":256,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/xFoLN7gebhJYbBRharHKc5sjNBY.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2000-10-03","episode_count":24,"id":255,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/vY89KM4tkQHDjHulZSMm6UWToRq.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2001-11-14","episode_count":21,"id":254,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/fxJK5nkcF2atVQWEsLcgcfP36v0.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":36,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5253370319c2957940045b97","air_date":"2000-03-20","episodes":[{"air_date":"2000-03-20","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":4005,"name":"Sex With Pudding","overview":"Titus believes that Erin is cheating on him and goes to her place of work to confront her about the situation.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":89,"still_path":"/zGsoqyzhg0d2zfnt2TQDodCicES.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5253371919c29579400464cc","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1212905,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Brian Hargrove","original_name":"Brian Hargrove","popularity":2.441,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5253371b19c295794004655a","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212911,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jeff Melman","original_name":"Jeff Melman","popularity":2.847,"profile_path":"/jGGU0EBFOWGUrlOLqO827yjWWqu.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5253371919c29579400464e6","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80104,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jack Kenny","original_name":"Jack Kenny","popularity":2.035,"profile_path":"/y52nNWUShhjHQSRRpmV0nfbXeH2.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"5253372b19c2957940046d8a","order":545,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1212920,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Courier","original_name":"David Courier","popularity":0.764,"profile_path":null},{"character":"","credit_id":"5253370719c2957940045c8f","order":564,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":137167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Adam Hicks","original_name":"Adam Hicks","popularity":5.793,"profile_path":"/s2VvxwMUeHwGYaVZJg188T90DQK.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2000-03-27","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":4007,"name":"Dad Is Dead","overview":"Dave and Titus panic when they realize their dad, Ken, hasn't come out of the bedroom in four days, not even to get a beer.
