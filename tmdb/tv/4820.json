The show was Anderson's first in over a decade to utilize puppets for its characters, and also his last. Anderson's previous puppet-laden TV series included Thunderbirds and Captain Scarlet and the Mysterons.\n\nSet in the year 2020, the series followed the adventures of the Terrahawks, a taskforce responsible for protecting Earth from invasion by a group of extraterrestrial androids and aliens led by Zelda. Like Anderson's previous puppet series, futuristic vehicles and technology featured prominently in each episode.","popularity":3.67,"poster_path":"/rCIA8UxTTi2Um2bIz3TQVyClMj7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":1,"id":14566,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1983-10-03","episode_count":13,"id":14565,"name":"Season
