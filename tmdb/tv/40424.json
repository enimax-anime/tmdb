Their leader, a professionally-trained driver named Kyoichi Sudo, challenged Takumi to a race at Akagi to “teach him some things” and as a sort of cover event for his race with Ryosuke, his primary target. Takumi declined his proposal at first but eventually accepted after being infuriated with seeing Natsuki with the Mercedes Driver which left him at a disadvantage from the get-go. This race saw Takumi's Eight-Six blow its engine. While it may have been a defeat for Takumi, Kyoichi did not consider it a race instead considering it more as a seminar to show Takumi how much he needs a better car as he believes the Eight-Six is far too old to match Takumi's skill level.","poster_path":"/Ad4SFi6CLFr7hzANxcBZSqQ06Fz.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":8},{"air_date":"2004-04-17","episode_count":24,"id":51331,"name":"Fourth Stage","overview":"This series focuses on the exploits of the new team founded by Ryosuke, Project.D, which is composed of Ryosuke (leader and strategist), downhill specialist Takumi, uphill specialist Keisuke, and a staff consisting primarily of members of the Akagi Red Suns.

By this time, Takumi matures slowly into a more confident and knowledgeable street racer, while Keisuke improves on his technical driving skills. Takumi instinctively develops many new techniques through his own ingenuity after some prompting by Ryosuke, such as \"Blind Attack\", a passing with his headlights off so that his opponent is unable to see him coming and block him, and using weight shifting to execute manoeuvres similar to the gutter-hook technique on Akina.","poster_path":"/hUtkQeCagCXCo6AtDdnDfVhft5z.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2012-11-04","episode_count":14,"id":51334,"name":"Fifth Stage","overview":"Still working as part of the Project D driving team, Takumi Fujiwara and Keisuke Takahashi continue to challenge courses and teams in the Kanagawa Prefecture.

By this time, Takumi matures slowly into a more confident and knowledgeable street racer, while Keisuke improves on his technical driving skills. Takumi instinctively develops many new techniques through his own ingenuity after some prompting by Ryosuke, such as \"Blind Attack\", a passing with his headlights off so that his opponent is unable to see him coming and block him, and using weight shifting to execute manoeuvres similar to the gutter-hook technique on Akina.","id":51331,"poster_path":"/hUtkQeCagCXCo6AtDdnDfVhft5z.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},"4":{"_id":"52595d1b760ee3466192fe4e","air_date":"2012-11-04","episodes":[{"air_date":"2012-11-04","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":872990,"name":"Encounter of Destiny","overview":"Following their narrow victory against Purple Shadow, Project D's reputation is at stake after a pair of imposters parade around Saitama.
