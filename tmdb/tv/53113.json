The children enter Neverland to find a very unhappy Hook. The pirate ship is in complete disarray and Hook is not a happy camper. He wants everything clean...squeaky clean! Caught in the middle of this storm are Peter and the Darling kids. Thrown in with a bunch of dirty pirates, there may be a whole lot of cleaning to do for Peter and the gang.",
