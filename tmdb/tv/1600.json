He is, however, witty, well-groomed, upbeat and self-aware. Moreover, with more than a little help from his two best friends, he's equipped to conquer middle school minefields. From crushing bullies to crushes, from off- the-wall, mean and cool teachers to pop quizzes, elections and detentions, Ned knows that nothing, including the seventh grade, is as bad as it seems, and friendship matters most.","popularity":24.58,"poster_path":"/nmQJ1vR8fOhDHFriYrkImnGNz26.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":19528,"logo_path":null,"name":"ApolloProScreen Filmproduktion","origin_country":""},{"id":53592,"logo_path":null,"name":"Dolphin Entertainment","origin_country":""},{"id":56591,"logo_path":null,"name":"Jack Mackie Pictures","origin_country":""},{"id":5371,"logo_path":"/2GFJ3jJ7dhjqcOGj41aTwd3OhQT.png","name":"Nickelodeon Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2004-09-07","episode_count":13,"id":4404,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/4mFSo2P2FvZE2TpPIc47rT4RuYN.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":8},{"air_date":"2005-10-01","episode_count":20,"id":4405,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/qTVyAsagnlFyhq8Gay9pFPPLt5N.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2006-09-24","episode_count":22,"id":4406,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/nmQJ1vR8fOhDHFriYrkImnGNz26.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.524,"vote_count":900,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52570d80760ee3776a08d43e","air_date":"2004-09-07","episodes":[{"air_date":"2004-09-07","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":82056,"name":"Guide to: The First Day & Lockers","overview":"First Day: It's the first day of school, and Ned and Cookie discover Moze has taken Cooking instead of Art to separate herself from the guys for once. \n\nLockers: When Ned's new locker neighbor gives him a bad rep, he searches for a new locker.

Eventually, Ned gets to ask Suzie and she accepts. The only problem is Ned can't go to the party because he, Cookie, and Moze are trapped in Gordy's extra supply locker.\n\nLate Bus: When bus number 9 breaks down, all the kids are stuck waiting for another bus. Loomer makes a deal with Ned that he won't bully him for an entire year if Ned helps him get Moze's attention. Meanwhile, Cookie is leading a \"Cookie's Late Bus After School Tour\" in which he shows kids what teachers do after hours. We see Coach Dirga crying over a soap opera, and the worst possible thing ever, a teacher rap group taught by Lil' Romeo. Also, Moze makes friends with another Jennifer, but finds out it's her last day. And what we have seen, this may lead to a friendship between Moze and Suzie
