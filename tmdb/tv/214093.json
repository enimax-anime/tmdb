In Berlin, 25-year-old Linn joins a cult whose members, for a variety of reasons, desperately want to believe in life after death. Meanwhile in a hospital in the middle of Germany, Hanna wakes up after a serious car accident and wonders how her 14-year-old son Jacob managed to save them both from drowning. When, a few days after the accident, Jacob suddenly claims to remember a past life as a pilot of a missing passenger plane, he dramatically changes the fate of the three women. Is he telling the truth?",
