During the American Civil War, Custer had risen to the rank of major general, the youngest in the Union Army. He was demoted after the war during force reductions to the rank of Captain, but was reinstated in 1866 as a Lieutenant Colonel in command of the Seventh Cavalry, stationed at Fort Riley, Kansas. Many of the soldiers in the regiment were derelicts, former Confederates, or even criminals. The series was cancelled before the script timeline would have reached the Little Big Horn River of southeastern Montana, where all perished on June 25, 1876, in a Sioux Indian ambush,\n\nRobert F. Simon played Custer's commanding officer, U.S. General Alfred H. Terry, who disapproved of Custer's long hair and much of his methodology of fighting Indians. Slim Pickens starred as a scout named California Joe Milner. Michael Dante appeared as Sioux Chief Crazy Horse. Peter Palmer played Sergeant James Bustard, a former Confederate soldier. Grant Woods appeared as Captain Myles Keogh. Read Morgan, formerly a cavalry officer on NBC's The Deputy, appeared in the episode \"Spirit Woman\" in the role of a medicine man.","popularity":6.586,"poster_path":"/yIqwWLnQbls6ZRiqtvw9zaNOX6C.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1967-09-06","episode_count":16,"id":27704,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/3uTW9XocWOJ7b0w5zYDLiFG5CqN.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.7,"vote_count":3,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52584e37760ee34661022227","air_date":"1967-09-06","episodes":[{"air_date":"1967-09-06","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":548540,"name":"Sabers in the Sun","overview":"An expedition into the Black Hills becomes deadly when a lieutenant who hates Colonel Custer disobeys orders, forcing the 7th to return  to conduct a rescue.
