Who can produce the most innovative and ingenious gadget for pets? \n\nFrom a doggy treadmill to a flushing cat toilet, the duo endure animal mayhem as they test a selection of outlandish inventions in order to get some inspiration for their own builds. \n\nDespite being allergic to dogs, Jason opts for an automatic ball-launcher that takes the arm-work out of playing ‘fetch’ with a pooch. The idea is that the dog retrieves the ball and places it into the launcher. It is then hurled 30 metres and the process begins again. Because of her love of cats, Suzi decides to build a gadget for moggies. She always wonders where her cat goes when it disappears through the cat flap, so she develops a GPS tracking device and camera for cats to wear on a harness. \n\nJason heads off to a dog show to see if his device has the audience begging for more, and Suzi tests her purr-fect invention with TV vet Scott Miller and his cat. Which invention will be a hit with the pets and their owners? \n\nAlso this time, Ortis heads into the woods with ex-special forces hard man Mike Hawk to test the best pocket tools on the market. Jon, meanwhile, trawls through the top online photo-printing services available.",

Following a thorough trouncing in 2008’s Silverline Power Tool Drag Race, they decide to enter again this year. This time, however, the boys really mean business! \n\nFirstly, Jason and Ortis assess the competition. They take a good look at the vehicles that have been victorious in previous years and research the technology behind their success. They also evaluate how their team came so hopelessly unstuck last year. \n\nDeciding that chainsaw-powered vehicles are the way to go, Jason and Ortis enlist the help of ace engineers Stewart Pilley and Matthew Ward. They then track down three Stihl 8.7bhp chainsaw engines, and set about constructing a cutting-edge chainsaw-powered go-kart that might place glory within their grasp... \n\nThe team decides to source an old go-kart from a karting centre and strip it down. Ortis and Jason take out the engine, seat, steering wheel and existing wheels. The rear axle is also removed from the chassis and the gear ratio is calculated specifically for the chainsaws. Lastly, they paint the kart, add new wheels and fit protective plastic to the chassis. \n\nRace day finally arrives and Ortis and Jason head to Haynes Motor Museum in Somerset to see just what their go-kart is made of. Will Jason, Ortis and their chainsaw-powered go-kart blow the competition out of the water? Or will they be humiliated and defeated once again?",

While Jason discovers an astonishing camera capable of filming in 360-degree wraparound vision, Suzi opts to embrace the 3D fad. Suzi makes the potentially risky decision to build her own camera system, but she scores a coup when she lands the world’s only ‘emotion jacket’, designed to allow viewers to share in the intense sensations experienced by on-screen characters. Elsewhere, Ortis looks into the murky world of black ops warfare and top-secret research projects. Top of his list is the Little Dog project, run by the US military’s secretive DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) arm. The Little Dog is an incredibly advanced four-legged robot capable of giving chase to targets over rough terrain. Can Ortis persuade the creators to divulge the secrets behind this awesome new technology? Meanwhile, in Singapore, Jon and new girl Pollyanna road test the team’s top five in-ear headphones. Pollyanna soon finds herself being catapulted 200 feet in the air at 125mph on the end of a bungee rope – all in the name of research. Finally, Jon dons his whites and ventures into the kitchen with top chef Jean-Christophe Novelli to try out three of the best dishwashers on the market. But will any of the timesaving devices live up to the fiery Frenchman’s high standards?",

Pollyanna kicks off with a report on the Robocup - the most extraordinary football contest in the world. Competing against each other are fully autonomous robots, operating entirely without human control. Will the automatons have the footballing skills to pay the bills? Since the outcry over England's disallowed goal in the World Cup, goal-line technology has become a hot topic. Ortis gets together with former international referee Graham Poll to see if it is possible to remove the man with the whistle and run a game refereed entirely by technology. Meanwhile, Pollyanna takes aim at Jason in a series of gadget football games, as the pair choose their top five ways to play off-the-pitch soccer. Elsewhere, Jon is joined by renowned football commentator Alan Parry to select the best high-definition projectors available on the market. And Suzi indulges in some of the most expensive gizmos on the planet to choose the top five gadgets only a footballer's wife could afford.",

In this episode's challenge, Ortis and Jason venture into the office in a bid to transform the bland environment into a fun, productive space - using only their own gadget ideas.
