The Richmond-based Malloy Crime Syndicate is run by Jonah Malloy, a charismatic but dangerous father figure. The Richmond FBI branch has its own dynamic leader in Special Agent-In-Charge Lisa Cohen. Like any business, they must justify operations and produce results while wrangling lieutenants who are as flawed as they are hard-working.","popularity":3.925,"poster_path":"/q4b6vahiI8BdMIBu7jJAyU808Gf.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":15258,"logo_path":"/d6Aqo5YatP3SUkMi1PEwT0nK0GB.png","name":"DreamWorks Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":1558,"logo_path":"/wwaKUcOENHix2jxLfFBfNkCtOEQ.png","name":"Touchstone Television","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2003-12-02","episode_count":13,"id":2498,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5,"vote_count":3,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525409a019c29579402e9aab","air_date":"2003-12-02","episodes":[{"air_date":"2003-12-02","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":47935,"name":"Pilot","overview":"Rookie FBI agents Paige Van Doren and Todd Stevens are assigned to the Richmond, Virginia branch.

Agents Amiel MacArthur who was with Agent Somers when he was killed, grieve his loss tremendously, as does Agent Jennifer Sampson, who is a law enforcement officer by day; wife and mother of two by night.\n\nMeanwhile, on the other side of town, Jonah Malloy, the local crime boss who runs his organization with an efficiency usually exhibited by much more legitimate businesses, meets with his team of henchmen.
