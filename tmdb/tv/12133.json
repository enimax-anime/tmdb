Produced by Universal City Studios, 26 color half-hour episodes were aired on ABC from September 17, 1965 to March 11, 1966.\n\nTammy was loosely based on the three Tammy films; Tammy and the Bachelor starring Debbie Reynolds; Tammy Tell Me True; and Tammy and the Doctor both starring Sandra Dee. The films themselves were adaptations of novels by Cid Ricketts Sumner. The series was also partially influenced by other rural themed TV sitcoms such as The Beverly Hillbillies. In particular, there are similarities between Tammy's Cletus Tarleton and The Beverly Hillbillies' Jethro Bodine.","popularity":6.925,"poster_path":"/4nlt5TpYifw3NEvARLQzSeqNn6r.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1965-09-17","episode_count":26,"id":22805,"name":"Season
