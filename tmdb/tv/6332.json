It ran two seasons, for 21 episodes, on the television network UPN from 1996 to 1997. Lou Ferrigno, who portrayed Universal's version of the Hulk on the 1970s live-action TV series, provided the Hulk's voice for the true version from Marvel.\n\nThe show often featured cameo appearances by characters from other Marvel cartoons of the period. In the second season, the show's format, after UPN decided that Season 1 was too dark, was changed, and to give \"female viewers a chance\", the network ordered that She-Hulk be made a regular co-star. As a result, the series was officially renamed The Incredible Hulk and She-Hulk. The second season also featured the Grey Hulk.","popularity":14.424,"poster_path":"/wa60s9NSvrH87NFCArmobnIyNnh.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":185277,"logo_path":null,"name":"New World Animation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1996-09-08","episode_count":13,"id":16484,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/AauXTKQBejmD0jcEIxlve0hRIme.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":2.5},{"air_date":"1997-09-21","episode_count":8,"id":16485,"name":"The Incredible Hulk and She-Hulk","overview":"","poster_path":"/alMxSGCtD65X8afcIcj23mu9KoJ.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":4}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.241,"vote_count":58,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525785d119c29531db28ed94","air_date":"1996-09-08","episodes":[{"air_date":"1996-09-08","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":374024,"name":"The Return of the Beast (1)","overview":"Bruce Banner's latest attempt to rid himself of the Hulk is shut down by General Ross and Major Talbot.
