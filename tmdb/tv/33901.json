We catch the unearthing of a Roman altar dedicated to Jupiter that was originally carved in the 2nd century, when Maryport was part of the coastal defences linked to Hadrian's Wall.  11,000 years ago Flixton in Yorkshire was an island used by our very earliest ancestors, and it has preserved vital clues about their world and the wild horses they hunted and ate.  In Ardnamurchan, a 5,000-year-old cemetery - housing burials from the Bronze and Iron Ages... and an intact Viking boat burial.  A Tudor-era aristocrat's feasting hall is revealed... and how one night the revelry came to a very abrupt end.  One of the richest hoards of Pictish treasure ever found reveals the metalworking secrets of the mysterious tribes who ruled Dark Ages Scotland.",

Along the way she builds a picture of the horsemen's lives here on the northern frontier of the Roman Empire.",

We follow archaeologists uncovering a previously unknown Anglo-Saxon cemetery in Lincolnshire full of spectacular and unusual grave goods.\n\nWe go on the hunt for a lost Second World War reconnaissance Spitfire in Norway and piece together the story of its brave pilot.\n\nDeep in the vaults at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, we explore one of its greatest treasures, the Westness Brooch. We also head to the island of Rousay in Orkney, where archaeologists rescue a Neolithic tomb before it gets washed away and discover an incredible trace of our ancestors on a rare Pictish stone.\n\nIn Salford, a major regeneration project is unearthing the largest jail in Georgian England and its radical approach to crime and punishment.
