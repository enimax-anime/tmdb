Its original network title was The Ford Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show for the first season, and The Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse Presents The Lucille Ball-Desi Arnaz Show for the following seasons. It was the successor to the classic comedy, I Love Lucy, and featured the same major cast members. The production schedule avoided the grind of a regular weekly series.\n\nDesilu produced the show, which was mostly filmed at their Los Angeles studios with occasional on-location shoots at Lake Arrowhead, Las Vegas and Sun Valley, Idaho. CBS reran the show under the \"Lucy-Desi\" title during the summers of 1962-1967, after which it went into syndication.","popularity":6.766,"poster_path":"/ha0aHNPgcke8V0kN3hAUQ3oKTDd.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":39856,"logo_path":"/x929GPaOozzVA92B0IkjbucZRAk.png","name":"Desilu Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1957-11-06","episode_count":5,"id":5207,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/v9oqdNty9WdR8T4zmVXXhigxHm.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1958-10-06","episode_count":5,"id":5206,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/CUH0xTap9cggpkL5Ro35yCBJ5p.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1959-09-25","episode_count":3,"id":5208,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/zrdw7B1MUkQp5TYqfPYovJxSVzD.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.9,"vote_count":9,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5257167019c295711408eb2c","air_date":"1957-11-06","episodes":[{"air_date":"1957-11-06","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":111324,"name":"Lucy Takes a Cruise to Havana","overview":"This episode takes us back to the night that Lucy and Ricky first met and fell in Love.

Then Edie spoils Lucy's mission and the two men have fun at Lucy's expense.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":3,"show_id":1832,"still_path":"/2EApc6mXX0qksZMWCEufFFTgSTK.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257167b19c295711408ef18","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":91711,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Desi Arnaz","original_name":"Desi Arnaz","popularity":3.222,"profile_path":"/35smVw1DCoYTJL07x7f4eHv4idE.jpg"},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257167a19c295711408eefc","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1227385,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bob Schiller","original_name":"Bob Schiller","popularity":1.549,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257167719c295711408edd0","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1227382,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Bob Weiskopf","original_name":"Bob Weiskopf","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Supervising Film Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"63c88432142ef100dacfabf3","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3639302,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Bill Heath","original_name":"Bill Heath","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Set Decoration","department":"Art","credit_id":"63c8885570b44400c8beca58","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":224395,"known_for_department":"Art","name":"Ross Dowd","original_name":"Ross Dowd","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Assistant Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"63c8886170b44400aecd5b92","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1232480,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Jack Aldworth","original_name":"Jack Aldworth","popularity":1.929,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Costumer","department":"Costume & Make-Up","credit_id":"63c8886d2f3b1700937fc885","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":3157301,"known_for_department":"Costume & Make-Up","name":"Bob Christenson","original_name":"Bob Christenson","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"63c8889cabdec000e213da6b","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":66183,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Edward A.
