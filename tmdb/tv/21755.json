Then, Corey gears up to buy a devastatingly cool \"Transformers\" toy for the shop. Can he build a good deal, or will it all fall to pieces? Meanwhile, Rick tries not to go psycho over an Alfred Hitchcock poster that makes a cameo in the shop. And later, Chum travels to LA to iron out a deal for some vintage garb. Will he be able to thread the needle, or will his trip be oh sew pointless?",
