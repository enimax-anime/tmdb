The original pilot for the show was aired on April 1, 2008. Jon Glaser plays a man in the Witness Protection Program who moves his family to New York City so they exploit the situation by starring in a reality TV show about them being in the Witness Protection Program. Paul Rudd guest-stars in the pilot as himself. Eugene Mirman co-stars as a Russian hitman/aspiring stand-up comic hired to kill \"Jon.\"\n\nThis series is produced by Wonder Showzen and Xavier: Renegade Angel creators PFFR. It leans decidedly more towards deadpan humor, and does not use the black humor of their other shows. It is similar in format to The Office, in that it mocks a reality show setup, as if it were a non-fiction, documentary or reality show, not a fictional comedy.\n\nIn the first seven episodes, Delocated had an eleven-minute runtime; as of season two, each episode had a twenty-two-minute runtime. The off-season series finale aired on March 7, 2013.","popularity":7.617,"poster_path":"/daV0YFc0HNwm2JSDN0zwKm3kPe5.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":20112,"logo_path":"/3N6td1WWMtX7BPj5ja2U2mLJUQT.png","name":"PFFR","origin_country":"US"},{"id":69744,"logo_path":null,"name":"Unintelligible Grunt","origin_country":""},{"id":6760,"logo_path":"/h3syDHowNmk61FzlW2GPY0vJCFh.png","name":"Williams Street","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2013-03-06","episode_count":1,"id":28340,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2009-02-12","episode_count":8,"id":28341,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2010-08-22","episode_count":12,"id":28342,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2012-02-02","episode_count":10,"id":28343,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7,"vote_count":13,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258514a760ee3466105560c","air_date":"2009-02-12","episodes":[{"air_date":"2009-02-12","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":554915,"name":"Pilot","overview":"“Jon” and his family move to New York City in hopes of finding a new life in the witness relocation program.
