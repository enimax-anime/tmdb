The producers let several creative, attention-getting dancers through regardless of how well they can actually dance, but heavily weighted on their \"likeability\" for a TV show.  In the next round, the dancers are given choreography to perform in smaller groups for more talent-related judging.  They are to learn a solo routine as well as a partner routine, but the first day of LA auditions put so few people through that they skip the solo routine.  Several dancers are put through to Hollywood, and a few husband/wife teams are broken apart as one part of the team makes it through and the other doesn't.",

Dancers got one minute in front of the judges, and those with overwhelming \"yes\" votes moved on to the next round in Las Vegas, absolute \"no\" votes went home, and in-between dancers would be brought back at the end for a second chance in a group choreography routine. The first real joker of the evening was the man they call \"Sex,\" who was making his third audition show appearance and, once again, making a fool of himself. Nigel lambasted the guy, telling him he \"must just enjoy watching himself look stupid on television.\" And Nigel refused to call him \"Sex\" anymore, either. A visually impaired girl named Laura tried her best, but the judges didn't think her choreography was strong enough to remain in the competition. Mia, though, got very emotional and called the girl an inspiration because she had a close friend who lost their eyesight.",

After an opening montage that showed judge Nigel Lythgoe having pretty bizarre reactions to hip hop dancers throughout the audition process, it was time to get down to business. Sort of. It seemed like the producers had a little extra time to kill, so they offered up auditions from previous cities that they hadn't shown before. The first was Michael Kim, who auditioned in Washington, D.C., and popped his way to Vegas, where his fate was sealed in Season 2 after failing to make the mark in the samba. Next up were a couple of roommates in the Los Angeles audition. Katee Shean, the first of the duo, made it to Vegas. Her friend, Natalie Reid, got through, too. In D.C., a salsa dancing couple, Janette Manrara and Romulo Villaverde brought the crowd to its feet with some very impressive dips and lifts. But it was only good enough to get them to the choreography round. Janette faced the judges first, and got a ticket to Vegas. Romulo, not so much.",

                    "overview": "Thursday night's episode of \"So You Think You Can Dance?\" spelled the end of the road for two more dancers who pulled in the lowest number of votes. The opening dance was a cool, futuristic hip-hop looking deal that was pretty captivating. Guest judge Toni Basil's speech about how she got into dancing, not so much. Host Cat Deeley asked Basil to talk about how much of a challenge it is for the dancers to learn all the different styles they have to know on the show and Basil's response was, essentially, that there are all kinds of dance and you'll never be able to master them.",

No details. That's just the prize. So, you know, yay! After the first commercial break, judge Nigel Lythgoe went all \"Debbie Downer\" on the dancers, telling them that they'll have to prepare themselves for rejection. In a minute-long speech, he said the word rejection -- or some form of it -- seven times, telling them dancers that by the end of the show, five of them will have been rejected. He said they should not dwell on it, but use it to propel themselves toward other opportunities. He then told them that each of them pulled in more than 1 million votes after Wednesday's performance show. Mary got emotional while telling them how proud she is of the progress they've made, and Adam told them to cherish the experience they've had on the show and to treat their fans well. All six dancers then performed their solos, and it would be the last time around the stage for two of them.",
