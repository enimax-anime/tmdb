A flawed genius who never lets anyone forget his flaws or his genius. Each episode will feature one compelling story of the week about life or death situations. The drama will focus on the way in which a serious injury or disease cuts across the lives of everyone involved, from hospital staff to patients to relatives. And how that group become, in an intense few days, a reluctant dysfunctional family united by hopes, fears and grief. At the centre of this stands Monroe, his trainees, his anaesthetist and his poker school - and his female colleague, heart surgeon, Jenny Bremner, who has contempt for his cockiness. The series will tell heightened emotional stories and be shot through with dark humour and portray the pressures and pleasures of high-end surgery in a modern urban hospital.","popularity":4.647,"poster_path":"/eM9PDGPp4VKwZGvZkm8P4qWdAkP.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5100,"logo_path":"/utZoiSvzfUPQMK3WmKgLTemHOOQ.png","name":"Mammoth Screen","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2011-03-10","episode_count":6,"id":44828,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":8.2},{"air_date":"2012-10-01","episode_count":6,"id":44829,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/cVDLDmBwXCPyQqc5EPMTD0eE5R.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":7.2}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":4,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258aabd760ee346616e7e46","air_date":"2011-03-10","episodes":[{"air_date":"2011-03-10","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":780811,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"At work, Monroe has the courage to perform cutting-edge brain surgery but at home, he is afraid to admit that his life is falling apart.
