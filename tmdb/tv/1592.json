Nigel Lamb is the current Red Bull Air Race champion, which makes him the airborne equivalent of Lewis Hamilton. His MX2 aircraft is Formula 1 quick as well. But Tiff and Vicki also have a very special machine, a £300,000 Lamborghini Aventador. Once Vicki has experienced a ride in Nigel’s plane, and Nigel has had a spin in the Lamborghini, it’s time for them to go head to head. The aircraft is faster, but the car can turn tighter. The result is very close.",

Tiff has the faster machine but must complete the longer, smoother route. Vicki’s vehicle is slower but she can take the rougher short cut. Does winning matter? Yes, because the loser will have to occupy the passenger seat as the presenters take on the most extreme off-road course, in Paramount’s most extreme machine. Expect hyper ventilation.",
