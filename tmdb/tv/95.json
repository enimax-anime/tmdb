Back in Los Angeles, her first Watcher had died; she inadvertently burned down the gymnasium at her old high school; and her parents got a divorce. The move to Sunnydale is supposed to give both her and her mother, Joyce, a clean slate. But then she meets the school librarian, Rupert Giles, and quickly learns there is no escaping her destiny. With Giles as her new Watcher, she reluctantly steps back into her role as the Slayer. But this time she is not fighting alone. She now has an inner circle of special friends-- Willow, Xander, Cordelia, and a mysterious young man named Angel-- ready to join the fight and drive in a stake or two if need be.","id":59465,"poster_path":"/AsnmRgMHZLwh0auGtbuJ8xc5smX.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7.4},"2":{"_id":"52599e1d19c295731c089e2e","air_date":"1997-09-15","episodes":[{"air_date":"1997-09-15","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":949425,"name":"When She Was Bad","overview":"Buffy returns from summer vacation sporting an attitude and suffers from recurring nightmares involving the Master.
