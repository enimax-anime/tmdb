It is produced by Left Bank Pictures, and co-produced by Palma Pictures. The series stars John Simm, Marc Warren, Max Beesley, and Philip Glenister as four long-time and middle-aged friends getting together in a villa in Majorca to celebrate the early retirement of their friend Alvo. However, after Alvo is murdered, the group find themselves caught up in the world of crime and police corruption.\n\nThe series was initially a story about a rock band, but changed after a feeling that bands have been \"done to death\". After gaining interest from some terrestrial networks, the series was commissioned by British Sky Broadcasting. Filming took place on location throughout the island of Majorca in May 2010, and took around four million euros and 44 days to make. The main themes are friendship and growing older; Glenister said it is about ageing and \"getting closer to death\". Photographer David LaChapelle directed three 30-second advertisements for the series. Mad Dogs opened with 1.61 million viewers, the 17th highest rated programme ever for Sky1, and attracted positive reactions from critics. They noted similarities with British gangster films, more predominantly the 2000 film Sexy Beast.","popularity":6.541,"poster_path":"/odGWpRfd8q3PvQ6EWNvYIEz5JC9.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5340,"logo_path":"/zHQ48Hg1In6SJB7WWCqVBfWsSwv.png","name":"Left Bank Pictures","origin_country":"GB"}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2012-01-12","episode_count":2,"id":49070,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/2skEJJq1kk8Vvf0d3oVhxRfa32f.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2011-02-10","episode_count":4,"id":49068,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/j7KNBk5yQnsPQtmdHteDbX8PU3X.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2012-01-19","episode_count":4,"id":49069,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/A8x5j5QIucaSyG94YS1RAXZsXaY.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2013-06-04","episode_count":4,"id":49071,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/bDxRpl5u15crUAxyZ1x6vXN0HV3.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2013-12-28","episode_count":2,"id":49072,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/1lj7uIpYdEceiR6fv3t2GMDtV3H.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":9.3}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.019,"vote_count":54,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258ead3760ee3466188d869","air_date":"2011-02-10","episodes":[{"air_date":"2011-02-10","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":851139,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"Four life-long friends visit Majorca to meet up with the fifth member of their gang to celebrate his early retirement, only to become entangled in a web of deception and murder.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":37737,"still_path":"/x7PZC4gQCJJvcK3wiaenecXmT1D.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-02-17","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":851140,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"Tensions simmer as Woody, Quinn, Baxter and Rick stumble into a scenario that is spiralling out of control.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":37737,"still_path":"/r0qMO5ToUvhEAhCJhjhe9Jp1XKE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-02-24","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":851142,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"The friends realise the gravity of their situation and come up with a plan to make Alvo's murder look like a Russian Mafia hit, fearful that gangsters will soon come looking for their money.

Mackenzie lets them go, and as an extra, allows them to keep the €5,000,000 payment, and lets them go, instructing them to board a cargo container, which will take them back to the mainland via ferry.
