Briana is now living on her own as she goes to college and Vicki has learned that with both kids out of the house, the only way she can maintain any control over them is with money.\n\nLauri is awash in wedding plans as her upcoming nuptials to George consume her every thought and deed. George's eldest daughter, McKenzie, is about to graduate from high school and hopes desperately to get a trip to Miami Beach as her graduation present.\n\nJeana is excelling as a real estate agent in the community while Shane struggles with a recent back injury, which is keeping him from playing professional baseball. As usual, Kara and Shane fight while Jeana's husband Matt tries to keep his cool. Kara and kid brother, Colton, bond after the death of their dog, Shire.\n\nA major tragedy has befallen Tammy and her daughters, Megan and Lindsey. Their father (and Tammy's ex-husband) Lou Knickerbocker, recently died of a heart attack. Without a will to provide for them, Megan and Lindsey are now forced to fend for themselves while Lou's young widow gets everything he had. Lindsey – who was living with Lou at the time of his death – was kicked out of the house by Lou's young wife, leaving her no choice but to move in with sister, Megan. They both live above Tammy's water damaged home, which is under renovation. Their future is uncertain and their lives will never be the same again.\n\nMeanwhile in the Keough household, Jeana's daughter Kara is graduating from high school and planning a graduation party. Younger brother Colton is becoming more like his older brother Shane as his antisocial behavior escalates. Newly single Kara (recently broken up with boyfriend Steven) is devastated when Colton doesn't show up for her graduation. Shane leaves to play minor league baseball in Canada.\n\nNewest and hottest housewife Tamra – on the verge of turning 40 - is a realtor and mother of four. Her eldest son, Ryan, whom she had when she was only 18, is from a previous marriage. The 21-year-old moved out of the house when he turned 18 because of tension between himself and Tamra's current husband, Simon. But now that he's moving back home, sparks are about to fly, with Tamra caught in the middle.",

Unfortunately, Vicki is having buyer's remorse. Vicki likes her big home in Coto and struggles with the notion that downsizing equals failure.\n\nHaving just graduated from high school, Kara has been accepted to UC Berkeley. Eager to check out the campus, the Keoughs leave for Northern California, but forget to tell Colton, leaving him home alone.\n\nSince the death of Lou Knickerbocker, Tammy has tried to be a supportive mother to her daughters. Lindsey is keeping busy with the Lou's Legacy, the OC Angels, but a recent car accident in the Hummer sends the \"Angels\" to the California Speedway for some much needed driving lessons.\n\nMeanwhile, as Lauri and George begin to build a life together, Lauri decides to put her townhouse up for sale. Unfortunately for Ashley, that means having to find another place to live – but not before a visit to the Playboy Mansion.\n\nTamra is rapidly approaching 40, but she's not ready to age gracefully. Conscious of the fact that she's been raising children for the last 21 years, Tamra is up for anything that will keep her youthful, including riding on the back of a Harley Davidson and hanging out with biker dudes.",
