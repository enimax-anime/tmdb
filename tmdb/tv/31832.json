Simon Cowell's return to U.S. television on \"The X Factor\" arrives Wednesday night, sporting the largest prize in TV history: a $5 million recording contract.\n\nThe judges are introduced: In addition to Simon, we've got Nicole Scherzinger, L.A. Reid, Paula Abdul, \"and introducing...\" Cheryl Cole.\n\nThe opening sequence features big, dramatic moments -- including Paula sobbing like nobody's business, and Simon saying he's \"hating this,\" the whole thing is some kind of bleeped expletive and it's \"just not working.\" Then we get title music that sounds eerily similar to \"America's Got Talent.\"\n\nHost Steve Jones explains the whole deal: The first audition in L.A. has 20,000 people waiting to audition, which Steve calls a record audition turnout for the city. The rules: Anyone over 12 can audition, either solo or in a group.\n\nThen the judges are introduced -- again. Simon says he \"walked away from the number one show in America to start a new show. The whole thing's a gamble.\" L.A. Reid says he walked away from his job as chairman at Island-Def Jam Records. Cheryl Cole joins the auditions in L.A., and Paula is back, saying she's \"looking forward to sitting next to my partner in crime.\"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":31832,"still_path":"/rYSeeRa6aB4mVqJXksdM8MCWJGF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-09-22","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":760815,"name":"Auditions No. 2","overview":"The premiere season of the \"The X Factor\" continues its auditions in Miami and Dallas as the quest for the $5 million recording contract winner continues.\n\nFirst up is Miami, where 29-year-old Ashley Sansone wears a glittery dress and says people mistake her for a pop singer. This doesn't seem like it's going to end well and she says she wants to channel all her energy into the audience and shares that her email address is \"unstoppable talent.\" She doesn't want to sing songs about Gummi Bears. She starts singing what sounds like Janis Joplin's \"Piece of My Heart.\" But she might have spared the show some royalties because her lyrics are completely unintelligible. L.A. Reid says he wanted to slit his wrists while she was singing. Simon says he couldn't understand a word she sang.\n\nThis kicks off a string of bad acts, including a terrible singer who demands an explanation before leaving the stage, a trio of cowboy-hat-wearing fellas, and a mom-and-daughter duet who call themselves \"Dreamgirlz, with a 'z'.\"\n\nGloria Estefan is apparently hoping the rhythm is going to get someone, as she tries to inspire the waiting contestants.\n\nFinally, we get a fresh-faced girl who's got a bunch of family with her. Caitlynne Curtis, 16, shows some serious nerves while she sings just the opening bit of Katy Perry's \"Firework.\" Nicole Scherzinger says \"there's room to grow.\" Simon says that's not good news and suggests that she join a group where she doesn't have to \"rely on a fantastic vocal.\" Simon votes no and Caitlynne starts to cry. Paula's worried a breakdown is coming and runs up to the stage to give Caitlynne a supportive hug.\n\nFed up, Simon tells one of the producers, \"I hope this is the worst session.\" The judges take a break and Simon's none too pleased with the talent in Miami. Paula is worried for Simon.
