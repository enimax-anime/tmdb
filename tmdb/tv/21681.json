It is the first stand-alone web series launched by a major television network. The series stars Tony Hale as a typical office-working, self-confidence-lacking nerd who discovers he can undo things in real life. It is an adaptation and expansion of the short film Ctrl Z by Robert Kirbyson, which was a winner at the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nCTRL was spotted and developed by SXM from the original short film Ctrl Z, which was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 2008. SXM ultimately partnered with NBC's digital studio to produce the online series. After NBC shut the digital studio in 2011, all rights reverted to SXM, who are currently developing Season 2 with Yahoo and a private investor. As of early 2012, the episodes appear to have been removed from the NBC website, but can be found on Hulu.","popularity":2.685,"poster_path":"/fC3OWjpmTwZOpb2KXN3LOFfS2Ny.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":166315,"logo_path":null,"name":"SXM","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2009-08-01","episode_count":5,"id":31461,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2009-07-14","episode_count":10,"id":31460,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52586ace760ee346611b16c0","air_date":"2009-07-14","episodes":[{"air_date":"2009-07-14","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":599172,"name":"Ctrl","overview":"Stuart, an office loner, discovers that he can manipulate the reality of his office from a magical keyboard.
