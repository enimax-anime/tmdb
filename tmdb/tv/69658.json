We are asking politicians this week, Can You Not? If you need to come up with an acronym for SCAM, surely you can do better than Samajwadi Party, Congress, Akhilesh and Mayawati.\n\nBack To School With Kanan &amp;  Biswa: This week we debut Off Script, a brand new segment featuring the boys from AIB chatting with Biswa Kalyan Rath and Kanan Gill. With final examinations beginning around the country, we've got AIB talking about their own experiences with college and exams.",
