Originally, Chatsworth Television intended to make a British version of the French show Fort Boyard, but when it became clear that the fort would not be available at the time of the pilot show, Fort Boyard's creator Jacques Antoine was consulted about developing an alternative format that could be shot elsewhere. As a result, the show ended up using a concept similar to Fort Boyard, but was substantially different in presentation and style. It was filmed on a very large set, originally at H Stage in Shepperton Studios, but in later series at an adapted aircraft hangar named Aces High Studios, at North Weald Airfield in Essex. Channel 5 later bought the rights to Fort Boyard and made their own version, using the original set, running from 1998 to 2001.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":2818,"still_path":"/qdCTiTXtjvXh2ies5YXdjB47ypy.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1990-03-22","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":217492,"name":"Lorraine Molloy (20), Jane Pares (29), Paul Alford (26), Jim Collier (34), Pamela Hodgkins (30), Mark Goodman (23)","overview":"The Sixth Episode. The set was divided into four \"zones\" set in different periods of time and space. For the first three series, the zones were Aztec, Futuristic, Medieval and Industrial. From series four onwards Industrial was replaced by Ocean (set on the S.S. Atlantis, a sunken ship trapped in an air bubble on the edge of an abyss in the Pacific Ocean). At the centre of the maze was the Crystal Dome, a giant geometric acrylic glass 'crystal' where the teams play their final challenge after playing games in each of the four Zones.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":2818,"still_path":"/7YWKNlgJ27X6L8davq26lbzbX8w.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1990-03-29","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":217489,"name":"Pat Brown, Gad Delworth, Claire Bethell, Elaine Day, Martin Murphy, Jeremy Taylor","overview":"The Seventh Episode. The objective of the show was to amass as many 'time crystals' (golf ball-sized Swarovski glass crystals) as possible by playing the games in each zone. When the team reached the Crystal Dome, they had to collect as many gold \"tokens\" as possible in order to win a prize. Each crystal that the team won earlier would allow them five seconds of time in the Dome.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":2818,"still_path":"/clCUy2l1s8OexOqzoFsPyIQ7ErL.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1990-04-05","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"standard","id":217494,"name":"Celia Poole, Alison Horne, Nigel Ward, Jeffrey Priest, Philip Hawthorne, Elizabeth Reeves","overview":"The Eighth Episode. In each episode, a team consisting of three men and three women (including a team captain and vice-captain) would enter the 'maze'. The teams were put together by Chatsworth from individual applicants, only meeting each other for the first time on the day before filming their episode. Gameplay was co-operative throughout. Starting from a pre-determined zone, the team played three or four games of various types in each zone, travelling through the four zones in either a clockwise or anti-clockwise direction. At the end of the show after playing all four zones, they entered the Crystal Dome.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":2818,"still_path":"/zjgKrpKt0Q0SbGcFPLxIYgtyr44.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1990-04-12","episode_number":9,"episode_type":"standard","id":217491,"name":"Dawn Window (28), Alan Holloway (21), Russell Barrett (21), Paulette Gordon Stewart (32), Martin Robertson (29), Fiona Thompson (29)","overview":"The Nineth Episode.

Each game had a time limit of two, two-and-a-half, or three minutes. If the contestant failed to exit the chamber within this time limit, before the timer hit zero, they would be 'locked in.' Additionally in a minority of games, known as 'automatic lock-in' games, the contestant could also be locked in by committing a foul, for example by touching the floor if this was forbidden for that game, or by setting off an 'alarm' three times. If the contestant breached the penalty rules in an 'automatic lock-in' game, they would be locked in straight away, irrespective of whether or not they had obtained the crystal, and regardless of how much time they had left. Contestants who were 'locked in' were unable to play further, unless the team captain chose to buy a contestant's freedom at the cost of a previously earned crystal, which could be done at any time after the lock-in.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":2818,"still_path":"/2QvxcC9LAadr1P0FPIdVrYfuNWF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1990-05-03","episode_number":12,"episode_type":"standard","id":217496,"name":"Peter Kelsey, Mark Wynn, Charlotte Elwes, Frances Webb, Cythy Alford, Miles Hadrill","overview":"The Twelfth Episode. Buying out a 'locked-in' contestant required a team member to physically take a crystal to the chamber where the contestant was locked in, leaving the crystal there in exchange for their 'bought-out' team-mate. If the team had since moved one or more zones further in their journey around the maze, this buying-out was represented[2] as a lengthy trip back through the maze that effectively took a second contestant out of action for at least one game. If both the captain and vice-captain were locked in, a new captain would be elected on the spot, although this never actually happened.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":2818,"still_path":"/33nr3m3KaWrR2cQhgY6ePrb5Zzq.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1990-05-10","episode_number":13,"episode_type":"finale","id":217498,"name":"Andrew Goodman (21), Kate Clarke (18), Rob Smith (31), Liz Cummins (28), Paul Griffiths (29), Sylvie Lewis (20)","overview":"The Thirteenth and Final Episode of Season 1. After competing in all four Zones, the remaining contestants entered the Crystal Dome, a 16-foot-high (4.9 m) replica of the 'time crystals' surrounded by a seven-foot circular moat and entered by a 3-foot-wide (0.91 m) 'drawbridge' which was hydraulically retracted once the team were inside. Similarly, one of the Dome's triangular panels was hydraulically opened and closed to let the team enter, then lock them inside. Inside the Dome, gold and silver banknote-sized 'tokens' made of foil were blown around from beneath the wire mesh floor by six huge fans mounted on a slowly rotating giant turntable, leading to O'Brien's catchphrase, occasionally delivered in a cod American accent: \"Will you start the fans, please!\" or Tudor-Pole's various elaborate intros, for example \"Let the mighty winds blow!\" In the Dome, and after the fans and turntable were up to speed with all the tokens swirling around, the team's aim was to grab the tokens from the air and post them into a roughly house brick sized clear plastic container mounted at waist height on the outside of one of the dome's panels. Tudor-Pole called it The Cosmic Pyramid, while O'Brien termed it The Letterbox. The container had a pneumatically-operated door on the inside, marked with a red saltire-shaped cross, which opened when the collection time started and closed when time was up.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":2818,"still_path":"/71EW7kwwINs5VUYER96t2givf7F.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":9125,"poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},"2":{"_id":"525747ef760ee36aaa0f4806","air_date":"1991-03-21","episodes":[{"air_date":"1991-03-21","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":217475,"name":"Keith Rowling (25), Chris Cairns (29), Erica Smith (28), Rosie Gaskin (24), Liz Maxim (16), Roland Hopkins (23)","overview":"So begins the Second series of the legend that is the Crystal maze.
