It was originally aired on Channel 4 and ran for two series, the first being broadcast in 2001, and the second in 2002. It was also sold to Fox in Australia, MTV in Italy, and the Middle East.\n\nThe series was created and written by Andrew Barclay and Brian West, who had previously worked together at the Edinburgh Festival, winning an award for an advert for The Jerry Springer Show, and on the sketch show We Know Where You Live.\n\nA total of 26 episodes of Pets were aired, all approximately 11 minutes long. They were shown in the early hours of the morning, and as a result, the series was fairly unknown, although it did gain a significant cult following. There was a demand on the official website for Pets to be released on DVD. Eventually a limited edition DVD was made available to purchase via the official website. As well as the two series, the DVD included two unbroadcast episodes, a clip show named \"The Trials Of Hamish\", and a behind-the-scenes special named \"The Making Of Pets\".\n\nSeveral episodes of Pets are currently available as a free podcast downloadable via iTunes. In 2010, a similar show named Mongrels aired on BBC3, sparking controversy between the two. The casts of characters in those two shows are almost similar as well, although Pets had four main characters while Mongrels had five. Also, Mongrels' range of locations is more diverse, while Pets is confined to a single flat.","popularity":8.091,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[{"id":70199,"logo_path":null,"name":"Fit2Fill Productions Limited","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"GB","name":"United Kingdom"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":2,"id":29660,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2001-05-05","episode_count":13,"id":29661,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":null,"episode_count":14,"id":29662,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":9.5,"vote_count":2,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52585a4b760ee346610ed0c7","air_date":"2001-05-05","episodes":[{"air_date":"2001-05-05","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":572681,"name":"Christmas","overview":"JP believes it is Christmas in the middle of March, and so to humour him, the other Pets decide to hold the event.
