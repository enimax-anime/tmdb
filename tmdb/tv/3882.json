Unfortunately for Martin, that print matches the only unidentified print at a major jewel robbery the previous year. In a routine cross check, the police find the print in Martin's file. And Tim covered the jewel robbery for the paper, something the police find probably more than just a coincidence. Martin and Tim find out that the police are watching them and the reason, and so Martin thinks it a good idea to flush out the jewel thief: he reads that there is a party where Mrs. Summer Winthrop will be displaying the galaxy diamond necklace around her neck, a lure too irresistible for the thief. At the party, the guests are populated predominantly by police - both in uniform and under cover - and the thief, Brian Henley, and his female accomplice, who Martin recognizes from the DMV office. Henley manages to slip the necklace off Mrs. Winthrop, slip it to his accomplice, who in turn slips it into the crown of the cap of Captain Farrow, the lead police investigator. Henley plans to steal the necklace back after the place has been unsecured, and he is no longer a suspect (he was the only person close the Mrs. Winthrop when the necklace went missing). Martin, seeing where the necklace was stashed, plans to plant it back on Henley. No matter what Henley does to get rid of the necklace Martin plants in his pocket, he is no match for Martin's levitation finger.

Tim's fear is realized: Martin's flight is spotted as a UFO. Martin needs to take another flight, but Mrs. Brown calls in the authorities - Jack and Jim being their representatives - who use Tim and Martin's apartment as a sighting station. Martin uses the opportunity to take his second flight since Jack and Jim have equipment - a plutron counter - that would be able to locate the space ship parked in the garage. The plutron counter does go off, but Martin slips some plutron into Mrs. Brown's apron pocket, making the plutron counter point in Mrs. Brown's direction. Jack and Jim think the machine has gone haywire. During Jim and Jack's kafuffle with Mrs. Brown, Martin slips away. While in flight, Tim further distracts Jack and Jim with a spoon dangling outside on their tree, which through Jack and Jim's telescope will look like a flying saucer. Martin takes his flight undetected and gets back to the apartment safe and sound. To further protect himself, Martin exposes Tim as the perpetrator of the flying saucer hoax - all in the name of getting a news story - with the spoon on the string as his proof of his claim.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":3882,"still_path":"/pWiXNix7STmAVlMPLRrvyoIOW1M.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257588619c29531db15e28c","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Goodwins","original_name":"Leslie Goodwins","popularity":2.253,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257588719c29531db15e357","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Komack","original_name":"James Komack","popularity":2.135,"profile_path":"/qC2YuxzIQHwoQDRuWoJeW2RmuQm.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-05-10","episode_number":30,"episode_type":"standard","id":271890,"name":"How Are You Gonna Keep Them Down on the Pharmacy?","overview":"The Earthly environment is causing a vitamin deficiency in Martin. He draws on energy and vitamins from everything and everyone around him. The effect on things is for them to go haywire. And if people look him in the eyes, they will fall asleep since they are sapped of their energy. Martin needs some vitamins immediately or else he will grow weaker and weaker to the point of no return. Luckily, the vitamins he needs can be found at any pharmacy, however by prescription. Also it's Sunday and all the stores are closed. But Tim convinces his good friend, Doc Mullen, to open his pharmacy. Martin's plan is that he will try and get the necessary vitamins while Tim distracts Doc Mullen. It does the trick and Martin starts on the course of his vitamins. However, Martin's illness is contagious and Tim gets it, which in turn causes Mrs. Brown, Doc Mullen and then Martin to fall asleep, with no more vitamins from Martin's stash to use. Thus Tim has to wake them all up without Tim or Martin in particular not to look at each other, as that will cause them both to fall asleep forever. With a lot of effort, Tim and Martin manage to do it as well as get the necessary refill of vitamins from Doc Mullen. Although Martin manages to get re-energized by the concoction, he is over-energized due to a higher than required dose, which in turn causes everyone else around him to feel over-energized. This can be cured by a good old everyday nap.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":3882,"still_path":"/lWJTVlVrHqQ8ZqFmHPCgMFEFzb6.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257588619c29531db15e28c","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Goodwins","original_name":"Leslie Goodwins","popularity":2.253,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257588719c29531db15e357","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Komack","original_name":"James Komack","popularity":2.135,"profile_path":"/qC2YuxzIQHwoQDRuWoJeW2RmuQm.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-05-17","episode_number":31,"episode_type":"standard","id":271879,"name":"Miss Jekyll and Hyde","overview":"Mrs. Brown's niece, Paula Clayfield, comes for visit. A former child prodigy, Paula has always relied on her brains to mask insecurities in her personal appearance. Despite her Plain Jane looks, Paula does have a boyfriend, Dr. Edgar Edgarton (her intellectual equal), with whom she has an \"understanding\" - they have a commitment to each other shy of a formal engagement. Paula notices Martin's sketches for a space ship, and insists on helping him to refine his design. Later, she also notices in Martin's possession a piece of a Martian alloy (something not available on Earth) to which she states she cannot identify its contents. These probings of course hinder Martin's progress in fixing his space ship as well as his hiding his Martian identity, so Martin asks a reluctant Tim to ask her out to keep her otherwise occupied. After Paula and Tim's first \"date\", Paula confides to Martin that Tim seems disinterested, which is indeed the case. So to get Tim to ask Paula out again, Martin transforms her into a ravishing beauty without her knowledge. This transformation does the trick on Tim, who continues to take Paula out and eventually asks her to marry him, which convinces her that she can be and is beautiful. Edgar comes for a visit, and after some time he notices the transformation in her appearance, which solidifies their commitment to each other. In the meantime, Paula has accidentally taken Martin's alloy, which she and Edgar are going to get tested.

In doing so, she gets Martin's levitation power. Martin temporarily fixes the symptom of appearing and disappearing by a concoction of household cleaners. But that is only in a need to get his levitation powers back from Mrs. Brown, which requires an electrically charged transfer. With much maneuvering and wiring and some hand holding (to control Mrs. Brown's levitation, but which she construes as Martin being affectionate with her), Martin manages to do the transfer successfully. After that, Martin and Tim need to try the grounding procedure once again. Just as they are about to do it, Mrs. Brown comes by once again, which Martin and Tim think will cause the transfer of the levitation power all over again. But Mrs. Brown fakes them out - this time, she doesn't cause a problem, and Martin's popsy is finally cured.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":3882,"still_path":"/dZ3umqpTqTJWvuPp8K7pY3ur8W5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257588619c29531db15e28c","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":103346,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Leslie Goodwins","original_name":"Leslie Goodwins","popularity":2.253,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257588719c29531db15e357","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":16008,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"James Komack","original_name":"James Komack","popularity":2.135,"profile_path":"/qC2YuxzIQHwoQDRuWoJeW2RmuQm.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-05-31","episode_number":33,"episode_type":"standard","id":271877,"name":"Oh, My Aching Antenna","overview":"Martin finds that he is prematurely aging due to the increased gravity on Earth compared to Mars.
