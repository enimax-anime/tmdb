Unfortunately, Captain Lee has his own plans about how those days should be spent. When the captain sets up a surprise fire drill, Aleks takes the heat for the ill-prepared crew. One night the crew enjoys a nice beachside dinner off the yacht, but the boisterous shenanigans of a few leave Eddie and David fuming. Much to Kat's chagrin, Adrienne and Ben seem to be getting very close, and when Kat puts her feelings out there for Ben to see, she alienates him even more. And when she launches a drunken rebellion against the Captain, it may very well cost her job.",
