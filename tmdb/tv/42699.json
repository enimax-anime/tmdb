housing complex in late-Communist Poland, whose lives become subtly intertwined as they face emotional dilemmas that are at once deeply personal and universally human. Its ten hour-long films, drawing from the Ten Commandments for thematic inspiration and an overarching structure, grapple deftly with complex moral and existential questions concerning life, death, love, hate, truth, and the passage of time.","id":69044,"poster_path":"/ynFPKp1Q2Nabcs8uR3Vn2uksFaD.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":8}}}
