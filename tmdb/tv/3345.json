Just beyond Earth's boundary with space, the Spindrift encounters a magnetic space storm, and is dragged through a space warp to a mysterious planet where everything is twelve times larger than on Earth, whose inhabitants the Earthlings nickname \"the Giants\". The Spindrift crash-lands, and the damage renders it inoperable.","popularity":16.81,"poster_path":"/ljbqDwgOoqYvQ6WRnuLr8QleEkH.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":null,"episode_count":7,"id":10347,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1968-09-22","episode_count":26,"id":10346,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/zn8zmkCOAoUmM4JjeCl2tX3PhQO.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1969-09-21","episode_count":25,"id":10345,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/mw8qrsoOjVteVlqCfc3EtT1h9Wb.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":8}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.632,"vote_count":34,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52574faf19c29531db0e08f5","air_date":"1968-09-22","episodes":[{"air_date":"1968-09-22","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":246080,"name":"The Crash","overview":"The Spindrift crashes on the Land of the Giants and its crew and passengers quickly find themselves in a struggle for survival.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":3345,"still_path":"/9fkrWrXXvRwmoL35u9B3Jz8UFsT.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52574fba19c29531db0e12a7","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7506,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Irwin Allen","original_name":"Irwin Allen","popularity":9.429,"profile_path":"/uKsIyvC13CEZ6UrhhT2DegCQtym.jpg"},{"job":"Director of Photography","department":"Camera","credit_id":"5c6544a1c3a36843c6d7e3b8","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27729,"known_for_department":"Camera","name":"Howard Schwartz","original_name":"Howard Schwartz","popularity":1.34,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Story","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5c65444492514177bdfc580b","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":7506,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Irwin Allen","original_name":"Irwin Allen","popularity":9.429,"profile_path":"/uKsIyvC13CEZ6UrhhT2DegCQtym.jpg"},{"job":"Teleplay","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5c6544540e0a262fa197db0d","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1242837,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Anthony Wilson","original_name":"Anthony Wilson","popularity":1.308,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Editor","department":"Editing","credit_id":"5c6545020e0a2625d197eec0","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1263020,"known_for_department":"Editing","name":"Jack Gleason","original_name":"Jack Gleason","popularity":0.84,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Giant Female","credit_id":"5c6545c20e0a26511197ef05","order":610,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1190696,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Anne Dore","original_name":"Anne Dore","popularity":1.686,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Giant Entomologist","credit_id":"5c6545d9925141250affba31","order":611,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2242226,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Don Watters","original_name":"Don Watters","popularity":0.652,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":"1968-09-29","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":246081,"name":"Ghost Town","overview":"The Earthlings find themselves trapped in an Earth-sized town run by a giant eccentric and his sadistic daughter.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":3345,"still_path":"/b4NswkSg51HKiIlR5e5GAdEJNBc.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52574fba19c29531db0e12fb","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15947,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gilbert Ralston","original_name":"Gilbert Ralston","popularity":1.694,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52574fb019c29531db0e09e4","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":44878,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Nathan H.
