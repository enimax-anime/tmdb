Created by Mel Brooks with Buck Henry, the show stars Don Adams, Barbara Feldon, and Edward Platt. Henry said they created the show by request of Daniel Melnick, who was a partner, along with Leonard Stern and David Susskind, of the show's production company, Talent Associates, to capitalize on \"the two biggest things in the entertainment world today\"â€”James Bond and Inspector Clouseau. Brooks said: \"It's an insane combination of James Bond and Mel Brooks comedy.\" This is the only Mel Brooks production to feature a laugh track.\n\nThe success of the show eventually spawned the follow-up films The Nude Bomb and Get Smart, Again!, as well as a 1995 revival series and a 2008 film remake. In 2010, TV Guide ranked Get Smart's opening title sequence at No. 2 on its list of TV's Top 10 Credits Sequences, as selected by readers.","popularity":61.446,"poster_path":"/AqhPucVAvnocglq5WYXbh6t9wuE.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":18201,"logo_path":null,"name":"Talent Associates","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2003-01-01","episode_count":27,"id":13327,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/gsdzRNNHm5zX94YpRFBLizCrUhm.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1965-09-18","episode_count":30,"id":13322,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/uikAWqHWKEhpQ5lGl0HMOSB2vVU.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":6.3},{"air_date":"1966-09-17","episode_count":30,"id":13323,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/1LPUlaeugf8pyxwKYQcRtfHZiX9.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1967-09-16","episode_count":26,"id":13324,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/51ezqaGiNrrmcLcSbaDEHP4VVWx.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":6.8},{"air_date":"1968-09-21","episode_count":26,"id":13326,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/sYIUAa0n3C5szwykTOiiEduIEyN.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":6},{"air_date":"1969-09-26","episode_count":26,"id":13325,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/f95KAo9N6DjkRfsOqDLXeBnr8Sr.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":4}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"And Loving It!","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.889,"vote_count":342,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525769bb760ee36aaa3c5401","air_date":"1965-09-18","episodes":[{"air_date":"1965-09-18","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":310027,"name":"Mr. Big","overview":"Mr. Big is blackmailing CONTROL: unless they pay him $100,000,000 he will use the \"\"Inthermo Ray\"\" to destroy the Statue of Liberty.
