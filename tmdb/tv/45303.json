This series follows Drew all over the country, including some privileged estates, as he hunts for old and forgotten pieces of history. But finding them is only part of the business; Drew must then convince the owner of each item to sell it to him at a fair price, then it's off to the salvage yard, where his team restores it to its original shine before it can be sold for profit.",
