Before 300 explosive charges bring the plant down, cameras get inside the action as the century-old boilers, turbines, condensers and generators are torn apart, revealing how coal power helped build 20th-century America.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":89618,"still_path":"/ezYxUsEaFA5hK8KBpGXoZgLuJz9.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-05-12","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1795678,"name":"Hovercraft","overview":"Southampton, on England's south coast, is the final home of what was once the biggest hovercraft ever built - the Princess Margaret. As crews strip it down, Zdenek uncovers the principles that allow this 300-ton amphibious craft to hover weightlessly over the ground - and the water. Zdenek explores how the era of mighty passenger hovercrafts was finally brought to a surprising end by cheap alcohol - and then joins the crew of an LCAC, the U.S. Navy's state of the art military hovercraft, deployed in some of the world's most extreme conditions.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":89618,"still_path":"/hlMzKkrzaApBiDGuAADTejxSZ3a.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-05-19","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":1795679,"name":"Deep Sea Oil Rig","overview":"Host Chad Zdenek joins a team that's pulling off an engineering first - dismantling the North Sea's biggest oil rig. As the 400-foot-high monster is towed ashore and then dismantled, Zdenek reveals the story of how, against the backdrop of a global oil crisis, deep water oil engineers raced to build an enormous machine to drill through the sea bed in their search for black gold. As he does, he unearths the dozens of systems that kept the rig pumping non-stop during its 40-year lifespan.","production_code":"","runtime":45,"season_number":1,"show_id":89618,"still_path":"/3PPtJVp4Qd1TM9i7x0J8elm5MOO.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2019-05-26","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":1795680,"name":"C5 Galaxy","overview":"Joining a team of mechanics responsible for stripping down and rebuilding the biggest aircraft in the U.S. Air Force's arsenal - the Lockheed C5 Super Transporter - Zdenek discovers what it takes to get 380,000 pounds of plane, plus its cargo, up in the air and back on the ground in combat zones.
