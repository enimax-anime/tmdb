As of August 12, 2008, Captain Flamingo was removed from the Toon Disney schedule but returned September 2 at 5:30 a.m. When Toon Disney got rebranded into Disney XD on February 13, 2009, Captain Flamingo was once again removed, and it hasn't aired in the United States since.\n\nThe titular character is of an unspecified young age. He has no real super-powers of note, just a desire to help \"li'l kids\" in trouble. His \"super powers\" take the form of novelty items, such as a whoopee cushion, among other things.\n\nReruns no longer air on YTV; however, reruns are currently shown on the Canadian Nickelodeon channel.","popularity":3.946,"poster_path":"/jsU1BnY8PWsggOKoKym0x9hirDr.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":5743,"logo_path":"/y8JaCRhsEz4ipl7MWE0ErxWVPYN.png","name":"Breakthrough Entertainment","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":173050,"logo_path":null,"name":"Heroic Film Company","origin_country":""},{"id":71739,"logo_path":"/9VhJRP6kUOJWH5QvSTeqMQFWuql.png","name":"Atomic Cartoons","origin_country":"CA"},{"id":18557,"logo_path":null,"name":"Philippine Animation Studio Inc.","origin_country":""}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"CA","name":"Canada"},{"iso_3166_1":"PH","name":"Philippines"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2006-02-07","episode_count":1,"id":21259,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":4.6,"vote_count":4,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525808a019c29531db3d8232","air_date":"2006-02-07","episodes":[{"air_date":"2006-02-07","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"finale","id":440245,"name":"The Flamingo has Landed/Pancake Panic","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":10889,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":21259,"poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
