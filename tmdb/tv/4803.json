In order to make sure she gets the role, Knoxie puts Cyril under pressure, who in turn tries to convince Cedric to modify the play in favour of Lady B.B.\n\nCedric agrees to 'improve' the script, and from this moment, odd things start to happen - Cyril has a series of utterly improbable accidents each time he tries to take influence in Cedric's writing. When they hear the phantom's threatening voice and realise there's someone behind the events, Bert and the pigs unpack their ghostbusting equipment (they've got the will, they've got the technology!) After a chase and fright sequence, the phantom is revealed to be another author formerly employed and exploited by Cyril, who wanted to take revenge, while saving Cedric from suffering the same fate.","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":4,"show_id":4803,"still_path":"/o1agKenUB4aQoshrV8cXcbscvIM.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"622fe20ccba36f00458ab425","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":3465874,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jim Betts","original_name":"Jim Betts","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1989-11-22","episode_number":13,"episode_type":"finale","id":343846,"name":"The Headline Hunter!","overview":"The pigs, mightily discontented with their living and working conditions, get in contact with scandal reporter Ms. Barbara LaFrame: a TV talker specialized in interviewing and tormenting rich people who keep their personnel as their slaves...
