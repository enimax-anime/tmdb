Rather than covering for them, Gustavo decides to teach the guys a lesson by making them get jobs to pay off $2,000.30 for the damages. Gustavo puts the boys on Freight Train's \"No-Swim list\" so they cannot swim in the Palmwoods pool until they pay all of the money back. Carlos becomes Gustavo's production assistant, while James attempts to become a model with Katie as his manager. At first, Logan and Kendall were going to be sign spinners. However, they get fired and start a babysitting service, which was not as easy as they expected. Eventually, Kendall and Logan make the kids wash cars. When Carlos is getting a coffee for Gustavo using an automated coffee maker C.A.L. (very likely a parody of H.A.L.), it makes a coffee with foam, and when it asks Carlos if he wants more foam, C.A.L. keeps on squirting more and more foam until the kitchen is full of it and more and proclaims it wants to cover the Earth in foam. The boys eventually pay Gustavo back his money, but then, people come storming in asking who will pay for setting up an illegal daycare service in the Palm Woods, using Palm Woods rags and towels, James' wardrobe, the coffee machine, and foam removal. Gustavo gets angry and wrecks his studio. Griffin sees this and asks him to pay him back the exact same amount of money the boys get fined. The episode ends with Gustavo, Kelly, and the boys washing cars.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":31356,"still_path":"/mD9KoJpLRFpuXHXVahWV13HKVCO.jpg","vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52589dd3760ee3466161f0cb","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":67966,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"David Kendall","original_name":"David Kendall","popularity":2.262,"profile_path":"/T8CQlPuHBRW0l3l5lmDBWaOaZP.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Kelly Wainwright","credit_id":"52589dd8760ee3466161f8f7","order":6,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1251213,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Tanya Chisholm","original_name":"Tanya Chisholm","popularity":8.047,"profile_path":"/7u2sJGlLvO6aB4SElKPQUlKbdgF.jpg"},{"character":"Wally Dooley","credit_id":"60b675eaa80673006edd2fa0","order":541,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1098562,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Angel","original_name":"Matt Angel","popularity":9.157,"profile_path":"/x8fCF9hS9qUtxtwXnaZKsyGLygc.jpg"},{"character":"Wendell","credit_id":"60b675faeda4b70041abda27","order":542,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1547923,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Evan Lake Schelton","original_name":"Evan Lake Schelton","popularity":1.594,"profile_path":"/vPusXzKhjM6BbVjdBQ3WEOjJZJW.jpg"},{"character":"Freight Train","credit_id":"60b670b65c563400589af1d4","order":550,"adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1223685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Stephen Keys","original_name":"Stephen Keys","popularity":2.285,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Arthur Griffin","credit_id":"60b66e1257d378005985a128","order":580,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78665,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Matt Riedy","original_name":"Matt Riedy","popularity":6.019,"profile_path":"/2IRLwSNIfym7daFEfeYCU2fAswf.jpg"},{"character":"Jennifer Knight","credit_id":"60b66d8c839d93003e1e797a","order":588,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":175570,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Challen Cates","original_name":"Challen Cates","popularity":5.828,"profile_path":"/7SnStJMLsZfqGW1oX64MXneYVnn.jpg"},{"character":"Reginald Bitters","credit_id":"60b66ed0a06645006e7ddedd","order":589,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"David Anthony Higgins","original_name":"David Anthony Higgins","popularity":10.55,"profile_path":"/oyyXzxtHMA8LeZ5oYm8tgxhnqm2.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2010-04-23","episode_number":12,"episode_type":"standard","id":754623,"name":"Big Time Blogger","overview":"The boys must impress a well-known blogger, Deke whose words can control their career.
