Eileen is a mom who usually has a fine grasp on all matters under her roof, and her soon-to-be-ex-husband Pat is a good-natured father and the emotional center of the family. Their normal routine at home suddenly gets turned upside down when Eileen and Pat announce their divorce, and their sixteen-year-old-son Kenny reveals to his family that he is gay. Kenny never would have imagined his admission would also result in outing his entire family’s secrets, including revelations from his older brother, Jimmy, and little sister, Shannon. Jimmy unapologetically wears his heart on his sleeve and genuinely tries to figure out what’s best in any situation, while Shannon is the youngest but carries herself more mature than her age. Life in the O’Neals household wouldn’t be complete without Aunt Jodi, Pat’s ex-sister-in-law and Eileen’s best friend, who is quite the frequent visitor and is also willing to admit things are far from perfect in her own life. What seems like a sudden upheaval that could mark the end of the O’Neals idyllic lives turns out to be the beginning of a bright new chapter when everyone stops pretending to be perfect and actually starts being real.","production_code":"","runtime":23,"season_number":1,"show_id":62856,"still_path":"/wpFoOKVORMm95HDeUPvmy9MOeYU.jpg","vote_average":7,"vote_count":2,"crew":[{"job":"Teleplay","department":"Writing","credit_id":"570306739251416cb20006f4","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":97263,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Joshua Sternin","original_name":"Joshua Sternin","popularity":2.448,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Teleplay","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5703067ac3a36806e20007af","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":97262,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Jennifer Ventimilia","original_name":"Jennifer Ventimilia","popularity":2.265,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Teleplay","department":"Writing","credit_id":"570305159251417ce00004d4","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527260,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Windsor","original_name":"David Windsor","popularity":1.62,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Teleplay","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5703050dc3a36806d6000684","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1527256,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Casey Johnson","original_name":"Casey Johnson","popularity":2.621,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"570304bdc3a36806e80006e5","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Todd Holland","original_name":"Todd Holland","popularity":3.741,"profile_path":"/2BadWgY9hzJKpiRG63fo6NuE2Xw.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2016-03-02","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1173155,"name":"The Real Papaya","overview":"Following the “coming out” confessions made by everyone in the O’Neal family, Eileen is desperate to control the situation and tries to make Kenny “un-gay.” Meanwhile, Kenny tries to find the right time to break up with Mimi and has a heart-to-heart with late-night host Jimmy Kimmel.","production_code":"","runtime":23,"season_number":1,"show_id":62856,"still_path":"/syz4LZNqHPje2uHWFyp4AKhlVV9.jpg","vote_average":8,"vote_count":2,"crew":[{"job":"Teleplay","department":"Writing","credit_id":"570305159251417ce00004d4","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1527260,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Windsor","original_name":"David Windsor","popularity":1.62,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Teleplay","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5703050dc3a36806d6000684","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1527256,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Casey Johnson","original_name":"Casey Johnson","popularity":2.621,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"570304bdc3a36806e80006e5","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1213162,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Todd Holland","original_name":"Todd Holland","popularity":3.741,"profile_path":"/2BadWgY9hzJKpiRG63fo6NuE2Xw.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2016-03-08","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1173156,"name":"The Real Lent","overview":"Eileen reminds her family that it’s Lent and asks them to give up things they really love, which in turn proves to be quite a daunting task.
