It was known for its excessive amount of blood used in every match and exaggerated physical injuries.\n\nThe series was created by Eric Fogel; with the pilots airing on MTV on January 1 & 25 1998. The initial series ran from May 14, 1998 to October 20, 2002, and lasted for a 75-episode run. There was one special that did not contribute to the final episode total, entitled \"Celebrity Deathmatch Hits Germany\", which aired on June 21, 2001. Professional wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin gave voice to his animated form as the guest commentator. Early in 2003, a film based on the series was announced by MTV to be in the making, but the project was canceled by the end of that year.\n\nIn 2005, MTV2 announced the revival of the show as part of their \"Sic 'Em Friday\" programming block. Originally set to return in November 2005, the premiere was pushed back to June 10, 2006 as part of a new \"Sic'emation\" block with two other animated shows, Where My Dogs At and The Adventures of Chico and Guapo. The show's fifth season was produced by Cuppa Coffee Studios and the premiere drew over 2.5 million viewers, becoming MTV2's highest rated season premiere ever.","popularity":21.617,"poster_path":"/aslBXglBwng8Sb3yrQ5zprp2jdU.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":59989,"logo_path":null,"name":"TakToon Enterprise","origin_country":""},{"id":59990,"logo_path":null,"name":"Cuppa Coffee Studios","origin_country":""},{"id":6042,"logo_path":null,"name":"MTV Animation","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1998-01-01","episode_count":4,"id":7617,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1998-05-14","episode_count":12,"id":7611,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1999-01-31","episode_count":21,"id":7612,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2000-01-27","episode_count":26,"id":7613,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2001-07-22","episode_count":20,"id":7614,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2006-06-10","episode_count":8,"id":7615,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/2wkv8VePXOc4dXufJbBe90Q92WZ.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2007-02-09","episode_count":8,"id":7616,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":6,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.616,"vote_count":324,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5257381b760ee3668d0055bc","air_date":"1998-05-14","episodes":[{"air_date":"1998-05-14","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":182493,"name":"Seinfeld's Last Stand","overview":"1.
