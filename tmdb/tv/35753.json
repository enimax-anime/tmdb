News of a victorious battle for the Tristain and Germania allied forces reaches a town that Louise and Saito are currently in. Saito discovers a sailor uniform on sale at a clothes merchants shop, and buys it, opting to give it to Siesta rather than to Louise. Upon returning to the academy, the two join Agnes and Julio on exploring a secret archive hidden beneath the school, which Agnes was denied permission. Agnes wishes to obtain the information there regarding her home town of D'Angleterre's burning to help carry out her revenge against those involved. Eleonore is picked to open to lock to the entrance. As the group heads farther down, they are joined by Siesta, who is wearing the sailor uniform Saito gave her earlier. After discovering that Saito gave the sailor uniform to Siesta because Louise lacked the chest size to make it look good, Louise blows a part of the cave in the way they came. With little to do but move further, the group finds the archives and are sent to look for the records regarding the town of D'Angleterre's burning 20 years ago. When Siesta trips and makes a mess of the books, Eléonore returns them to their proper place with magic, which triggers the archives' security system and begins to bring the bookshelves to a close. Agnes finally finds the information regarding D'Angleterre's burning, but a part of the page that lists the person who led the attack is missing. The group narrowly escapes the collapsing of the bridge that led them to the archives.

Siesta is happy to oblige and Saito also thinks it to be a good idea, however, Louise is watching and is preparing to blow something else up. When Saito points out that the cave in she made earlier is in the opposite direction, Louise tells him to shut up and blows them up anyway.","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":2,"show_id":35753,"still_path":"/pLcyBgld4LKxjXxezgrAVdhw6WD.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Storyboard Artist","department":"Art","credit_id":"63a8c3ae271ca500d9011d3d","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2723902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hideaki Uehara","original_name":"Hideaki Uehara","popularity":1.03,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"63a8c3bb271ca50093ffe0ed","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2723902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hideaki Uehara","original_name":"Hideaki Uehara","popularity":1.03,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2007-08-27","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"standard","id":809950,"name":"Crisis at the Institute of Magic","overview":"Albion sends hired mercenaries to make a surprise attack on the Magic Academy and take all of the people from the royal families hostage.

However, he refuses to sign it, insisting that it was she who asked him, and leaves. Upon seeing the shack where Professor Colbert kept his books and other materials, he entered and sadly remembered the teacher's wish to someday visit Saito's world. He apparently starts to doze off, but wakes up after hitting his head on the table. His attention then turns to the piles of gifts being left for Guiche and Reynald, and inquires as to their meaning, in which case, Reynald explains that gifts from the ladies are becoming more common after the fight with the Air Dragon Knights from the previous episode. With love seemingly in the air, Saito remembers the fight with Louise and becomes rather depressed. Upon seeing this, Guiche, Malicorne, and Reynald grow determined to cheer him up. A newcomer in the Knights of Ondine, Gimli, comes up with an idea, and they set about to digging a hole to the women's bathhouse, where they use magic to create a small peephole, bringing Saito along to join them. In the bath, Tiffania explains to Louise that it was she who asked Saito to touch her breasts. This leaves Louise a bit upset over her treatment of him, realizing that she didn't even bother to listen, and fears that he may not come back. However, when Tiffania makes the statement that the two are lovers, Louise immediately shoots that notion down. Saito yells for them to stop peeking at her, and his loud voice gathers the attention of Tabitha, who speaks up. The hole is noticed, and their fun is over. They manage to escape, but are found and swiftly punished by the girls. Saito, however, is saved by Tabitha (as a favor for him feeding her dragon earlier in the episode). When Montmorency comes into the dining hall looking for Guiche, Tabitha hides Saito in a rather provocative manner--by pressing her naked body up against him. When word that Guiche has been found, she heads off, but the sound of whispers gains Tabitha's attention, and she soon passes out from fear of ghosts. The dolls appear and start dancing, and Saito is reminded of the party from the first season. Louise shows up, explaining the nature of the dolls' appearance. She has him admit to being with the others who were peeking, but he explains that he was deceived, half expecting her not to believe him. She believes him, though, and they embrace. However, the embrace comes to an abrupt end when Tabitha wakes up for a brief moment, and once again, Louise gets the wrong idea. He ends up in the same position as in the beginning, only this time the pledge is for him never to touch breasts smaller than Louise's (or anyone else, for that matter). In protest, Siesta grabs Saito's hand and rests it on her breast, and in a rage, Louise blows him up.","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":3,"show_id":35753,"still_path":"/7UepUWJS9kek0ZNgUalcTzbYooF.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2008-08-11","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":809963,"name":"The Taboo Magical Potion","overview":"It starts off with Siesta at the imp cafe with her uncle and cousin, Jessica, telling her to try harder at getting Saito, eventually giving her a love potion.

In response, Saito, Guiche and Malicorn resign as knights in order not to trouble Tristan, and Henrietta responds by having them arrested. Louise asks Henrietta what she thinks of Saito as a man not a chevalier, and Henrietta admits that she is not sure if she has fallen for Saito or simply needs someone to lean on.

Siesta shows doubts at first of not having any powers but gets encouraged by Saito that she could still help. She hugs him so Louise kicks him in the groin from behind. In Gallia, Joseph and Sheffield uncover a massive object, which Joseph calls Jormungand, covered with pulsing veins and with a single large eye. Posing as a travelling circus, Saito and company cross the border, while Louise broods over no longer being an aristocrat, realising she only has Saito left. Back at the castle, using Siesta as a distraction, Gimli and Reinard take out two guards and they board the Ostland, after dispatching two more groups of guards. Colbert quickly fires up the Ostland, eventually ripping free of the chains that are tying it down. Agnes falls for the ploy, ordering guards to watch the Germinia border. Louise sprains her ankle, and Saito tells her to rely on her, carrying her on his back. She wonders how Saito is so strong, despite being alone in this world. The Ostland is eventually stopped by Tristan dragon knights, and Agnes nearly kills Colbert upon seeing him. Meanwhile, Saito and company arrive in Gallia.","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":3,"show_id":35753,"still_path":"/bDjos1r3OfoRMLeJH5TkyOg6VaR.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Storyboard Artist","department":"Art","credit_id":"63f516bfcaaca20085794bcc","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Youhei Suzuki","original_name":"Youhei Suzuki","popularity":2.367,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Key Animation","department":"Visual Effects","credit_id":"64b17aa7ba480200ad83b664","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2666709,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Yusuke Shimizu","original_name":"Yusuke Shimizu","popularity":1.298,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2008-09-15","episode_number":11,"episode_type":"standard","id":809956,"name":"Captive in Alhambra","overview":"Using her talents at persuasion, Kirche discover that Tabitha is being held in Al Hambra. Upon arriving in Al Hambra, the gang decide upon a plan of attack. Under the pretext of having a show, they will make the soldiers drink alcohol laced with sleeping potion. When Kirche doesn't assign anything to Louise, she gets angry and demands to be given something to do. Kirche reveals that she knows the Louise is a void mage, and apologises for her past behaivor, and invites her over to Germania. Later on, Derflinger advises Saito to say something to her, saying that Void magic is dependant on emotional strength. Saito decides to do so, and finds her posing in front of a mirror in a dancing costume. Louise begins to tempt Saito, and Saito pushes her onto the bed, but they are interrupted by Guiche. In Tristan, Agnes frees Colbert. She saids that she cannot forgive him for burning her village, but has a chance to end the cycle of hatred that would erupt should she kill Colbert. Back in Al Hambra, the Baron wants Louise to attend to him personally, and she agrees, planning to drug his wine, but discovers that the sleeping potion slipped out of her bra. Saito and Tifa discovers the bottle and go to rescue Louise, Tifa using her magic to wipe the Baron's memories. Having drugged all the soldiers, they encounter Bidashal, who easily defeats all their attacks using Counter. Derflinger tells Louise to cast Dispell on him, which she does, allowing Saito to break through Bidashal's Counter. Tifa stops Saito from killing Bidashal, who tells them where Tabitha is and lets them go, and warns them that Joseph is a cold blooded man, and that it wouldn't end there. Tabitha is awakened by Slyphid, and cries upon seeing the gang, even as Sheffield spies on them using her butterfly.","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":3,"show_id":35753,"still_path":"/4lAeSUOIOFJ7Rqg6vJkbgReTRd.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Animation Director","department":"Visual Effects","credit_id":"60ab8f2cd18b240058f5e83e","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2397287,"known_for_department":"Visual Effects","name":"Sumie Kinoshita","original_name":"Sumie Kinoshita","popularity":0.652,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Storyboard Artist","department":"Art","credit_id":"63a8c3ae271ca500d9011d3d","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2723902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hideaki Uehara","original_name":"Hideaki Uehara","popularity":0.618,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"63a8c3bb271ca50093ffe0ed","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2723902,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Hideaki Uehara","original_name":"Hideaki Uehara","popularity":0.618,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2008-09-22","episode_number":12,"episode_type":"finale","id":809957,"name":"Wings of Freedom","overview":"Louise has a nightmare where she loses the ability to cast magic. Awakened, she goes into the forest to attempt to cast explosion. Saito finds Tabitha reading a book, and she began to teach him the words, but Louise interrupts, telling Saito that she can no longer use magic. Tabitha saids that she will protect Saito since Louise is unable to do so. In Tristan, Henrietta dispatches the Ostland and Colbert to rendezvous with Saito, carrying a type of cannon (which seems to be a German Flak88 from WW2), and Agnes offers the assistance of the Musketeer Force. Silently, Colbert hopes the weapon will not be needed. Saito, under Tabitha's guidance, learns to read quickly, while Louise broods over her inability to cast magic. Overhearing Tabitha telling Saito that under the influence of Gandalfr, the heart will experience changes, Louise wonders if Saito loves her because of Gandalfr's influence. Just before crossing the border, a Square-class golem, with Sheffield on its shoulder, lands in front of the carriage and blocking off the route into Tristan. Slyphid and Tabitha take to the air, in order to lead Sheffield away. Guiche, Kirche and Tabitha's attacks prove ineffective against the golem, which is protected by Counter, but they manage to halt the golem's advance with their spells. Saito realises her objective is Louise, and tells her to stay back, but she jumps out of the carriage as Malicorn pulls it back. She is grabbed by the golem, who began to crush her unless she uses her magic. Saito's attacks are easily stopped by Counter, and Louise decides to sacrifice herself for her friends. Saito leaps to attack the golem again, and this time, his attack damages the golem, which releases Louise, and Slyphid saves them in time. Colbert has unloaded the cannon, which Saito examines using his Gandalfr powers, and quickly fires at the golem, but the round is stopped by Counter. Colbert, Kirche and Maricom unleash their most powerful spells, and manage to stop it's advance. Derflinger tells Saito that Dispell needs to be cast on the shells, and Louise refuses, saying she can't do it. Tabitha then kisses Saito, eliciting feelings of intense jealousy in Louise, causing her void powers to be activated again. Louise casts Dispel on the ammunition, which successfully pierces the Counter and destroys the golem. On the Ostland, Louise awakens to see Saito, and asks him if she's okay like this. Saito hugs her, and again declares his love for her, saying he does not love her just because he is Gandalfr. Then Louise kisses Saito while claiming that she has to because he's her familiar. Back in Tristan, Louise kneels before the queen, awaiting punishment for defying her. Henrietta punishes her by awarding her the royal mantle, declaring that Louise is now her sister and second successor to the throne, as well as returning Saito his Chevalier cloak. She then welcomes Tabitha as Princess Charlotte back to Tristan. The ending credits also show Maricom and Guiche wearing their mantles with their school uniforms, signifying that Henrietta has reinstated their noble status. When Louise tries to explode Saito when she sees Tabitha holding onto Saito, Sylphid grabs Saito and escapes with Tabitha.","production_code":"","runtime":25,"season_number":3,"show_id":35753,"still_path":"/AeuVkSeXPkyJpnO2z9wJ9tvQZdb.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Storyboard Artist","department":"Art","credit_id":"63f516bfcaaca20085794bcc","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Youhei Suzuki","original_name":"Youhei Suzuki","popularity":2.367,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"63f516c0a67254007deaa78c","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1489099,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Youhei Suzuki","original_name":"Youhei Suzuki","popularity":2.367,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"The Familiar of Zero: Rondo of Princesses","overview":"","id":46516,"poster_path":"/we7TXqImueNbE5k1op9S5HDkNoh.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":0},"4":{"_id":"5258e07f760ee346617a95e6","air_date":"2012-01-07","episodes":[{"air_date":"2012-01-07","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":809975,"name":"Louise of the Holy Land","overview":"Queen Henrietta has ordered everyone to Romalia, once there they meet the Pope of Romalia, Saint Aegis the 32nd.
