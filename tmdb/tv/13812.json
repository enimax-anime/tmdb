She has been protected and cared for by Mrs Sucksby (Imelda Staunton) who believes Sue is too good a girl to get directly involved in such a world. But when Mrs Sucksby's old friend Richard Rivers (Rupert Evans) offers 20-year-old Sue Â£3,000 to assist him in one of his scams, Mrs Sucksby cannot resist. Passing himself off as a proper gent, Rivers has befriended a young lady, Maud Lilly (Elaine Cassidy), who stands to inherit a fortune when she marries. However, Maud's maid has recently left her service and, without a chaperone, Rivers' access to Maud is limited. He wants Sue to be accepted as the new maid and to help him win Maud over. Once married, Rivers plans to have Maud committed to an asylum and he will then take her fortune for himself. Arriving at Briar, the estate where Maud lives with her wealthy bookish Uncle Lilly (Charles Dance), Sue enters another world.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":13812,"still_path":"/jpjvRxonfl2qZ00r9mDZ7JfnAwZ.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2005-04-03","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":506260,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"Having disposed of Sue, Rivers takes Maud to London to Mrs Sucksby's house. There Maud learns that Mrs Sucksby is the mastermind behind her escape and Sue's downfall. Maud is plagued by doubts over her treatment of Sue and the fake life that she presented. In reality Maud was orphaned and brought up by her Uncle, a cruel man, who has abused his niece and hardened her heart. The nightly readings in his library were not as innocent as it appeared to Sue. Maud was forced to read pornography to her uncle and his friends. Tormented by the cruelty of her existence, Maud found in Rivers a way out. By marrying him, she could escape the prison of her uncle's house. But what Maud hadn't expected was to be so affected by her friendship with Sue - or indeed that she would fall in love with her. In order to save herself from her uncle, Maud had to reconcile herself to hurting Sue. But even Maud couldn't have imagined that her world would be further turned upside down.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":13812,"still_path":"/8fAnsIBtt03V9Zr0X8H2oGqhigE.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2005-04-10","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"finale","id":506261,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"Acknowledging the wrong she has done, Maud knows she must escape Mrs Sucksby if she is to rescue Sue.
