The day of her wedding starts off calm, but when the venue tells Korliss that there will be no music when she walks down the isle, Korliss is steamed. She does find her own way to have music playing and the rest of the day is like a fairytale wedding.\n\nNoelle is only a day away from her wedding to Dan. So, how will she find time to get a marriage license and get the reception organized? The day of her wedding is even more of a mess. She starts it off by being over an hour late to the salon for hair and make-up and then she is late to the church. When the bouquet is handed to her, she freaks out because the roses are the wrong color. With another wedding scheduled right after hers, the priest decides to shorten Noelle�s wedding in order to end in time. After all the fuss, Noelle is at least able to enjoy her reception.",

At the rehearsal, Erica's fiance calls into question the entire wedding when he finds out about a wild night, sending our Bridezilla into an emotional tailspin. When the wedding day arrives, not only is it pouring rain, but after Erica is caught telling a bold faced lie, she spends most of the day screaming at her mother and sisters.

Meanwhile, Bridezilla Delilah gave her wedding guests the wrong directions, and treats her bridal party like her personal servants. Delilah flips out when her sunglasses get scratched, and later, when the bridesmaids' dress alterations take too long, Delilah takes it out on them by refusing to drive them home. But while the bridesmaids slave away, the Maid of Honor is curiously missing in action... On the wedding day, a cranky Delilah takes out her nerves and frustrations on everyone around her, freaking out when the groom spots her before the ceremony.",

On the wedding day Angel and her groom get into a huge fight, and then it actually hails during the outdoor ceremony. But the most shocking moment of the season comes at the very end when Angel accuses her husband of infidelity -- at their wedding reception!",

Michelle even insists on giving her groom a golden glow at the tanning salon. Sadly, Greg’s attempt at payback fails when he insists on a more intense baking session, and ends up looking more lobster than lifeguard. But when push comes to shove, this priss-zilla isn’t afraid to run to mommy and daddy when she fails to lock down her own caterer. But there’s only so much of this behavior her family and friends can take before they start pushing back.

At her bachelorette party, this ‘Zilla greedily gobbles up their gifts, thanking her bridesmaids by treating them like backup dancers and shoving her way to center stage during their dance routine. And woe to the bridesmaid who dares question Brittany’s ceremonial set-up, or the groomsman who hints at a bachelor party complete with strippers! But when all else fails, this bride to be isn’t afraid to resort to tears. When her wedding day finally arrives it seems as though all might be forgiven, that is, until Brittany keeps her groom waiting at the altar just a little too long. When he calls to check on her whereabouts, Brittany goes ballistic in the way only a true Bridezilla can.",
