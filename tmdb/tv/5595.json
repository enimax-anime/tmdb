On the The WB network on September 29, 2001. It is set sometime between 1920 and 1934. The characters and plot were derived from the film, but the series could not replicate its success, efforts to make it consistent with real-world features were almost non-existent as, for example, Lake Titicaca is described as both puma-head shaped and as being found below the ruins of Macchu Picchu. The poor quality of the animation disappointed fans of the special effects-laden movie. It was retooled and rechristened The Mummy: Secrets of the Medjai for its second season, which began on February 15, 2003. Although the quality is considered to have improved between the first and second seasons, the show failed to find an audience and was cancelled on June 7, 2003. Reruns of the show aired on Toon Disney. The entire series was released on DVD in America R1 in three volumes on July 22, 2008.","popularity":10.566,"poster_path":"/buHYTfxH7QSd24jVftSc2JFMfQL.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":4285,"logo_path":null,"name":"Universal Cartoon Studios","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2001-09-29","episode_count":13,"id":15676,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/7WqbBo4jJHYZVPKheFnqMoJp19W.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2003-02-15","episode_count":13,"id":15675,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/tyR5t8L5va1XafXYaNq75iJ7S8W.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5.9,"vote_count":19,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525781a919c29531db26a8c8","air_date":"2001-09-29","episodes":[{"air_date":"2001-09-29","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":363945,"name":"The Summoning","overview":"The mummy Imhotep needs the Manacle of Osiris to fulfill his quest to rule all mankind, but it's stuck on Alex's wrist, and only the Lost Scrolls of Thebes can remove it without destroying its power.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":5595,"still_path":"/hUKTnP5HYbC5dopUfduKDfUB1mg.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525781a919c29531db26a905","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214731,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Greg Klein","original_name":"Greg Klein","popularity":1.674,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2001-10-06","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":363941,"name":"A Candle in the Darkness","overview":"Alex and Jonathan find a hidden chamber in the ruins of the Library of Alexandria, and it just may hold the secret to the location of the scrolls.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":5595,"still_path":"/mTKIaULMIHvKPehjFEh2SZccZ8e.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525781aa19c29531db26a9b9","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":71540,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Steven Melching","original_name":"Steven Melching","popularity":1.238,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2001-10-13","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":363974,"name":"Against the Elements","overview":"A clue about the scrolls in the diary of Alexander the Great takes the O'Connells into the Egyptian desert, where they encounter Imhotep, who is also searching for the same palace.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":1,"show_id":5595,"still_path":"/h4Tw1MwAlOBxDL2zRmeFLEqQSm0.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525781a919c29531db26a905","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1214731,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Greg Klein","original_name":"Greg Klein","popularity":1.674,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2002-02-23","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":1743107,"name":"The Deep Blue Sea","overview":"When powers from the Manacle of Osiris start to manifest, Alex worries if he'll be able to handle them.
