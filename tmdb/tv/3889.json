Created and produced by John T. Binkley, the series was Nickelodeon's only teenage soap opera. The show was shot on videotape, similar to most daytime dramas.\n\nThe series was first conceived as Fifteen in an improvised form for The Disney Channel,  where a 13-episode pilot series was produced and tested in the U.S.  After Disney decided not to proceed with the project, Nickelodeon and  Canadian partners joined Binkley in producing the series which was known  in its first and second seasons as Hillside in Canada, and throughout the 65-episode run as Fifteen in the U.S. The show was subsequently syndicated around the world, with runs in Germany and Israel, among others.\n\nThe series features a large ensemble cast which underwent several changes over the show's four-season run. Notable cast members include Laura Harris, Enuka Okuma, and Ryan Reynolds.","popularity":7.708,"poster_path":"/lqkp0FYhXbQUSNT0bTvio21AjK7.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1991-02-03","episode_count":13,"id":11640,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1991-08-04","episode_count":13,"id":11641,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1992-02-02","episode_count":13,"id":11642,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1992-11-01","episode_count":26,"id":11643,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":4,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7,"vote_count":4,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5257589c19c29531db15f53c","air_date":"1991-02-03","episodes":[{"air_date":"1991-02-03","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":272239,"name":"Checking It Out","overview":"Brooke checks out Matt who obviously belongs to Ashley.
