Investigating the incident, the Calico crew journey within the crevice and discover a hidden valley where giant insects dominate, and an inconvenient earthquake seals the fissure and traps the crew within. Dr. Darian discovers that when sunlight is filtered through the strange clouds that surround the valley, a chemical reaction occurs in the insects that vastly increases their size.    Menaced by the valley's giant ants and bees, Godzilla is called, and he quickly dispatches the bees. After hurling away a tank-sized beetle that attacked the crew, Godzilla finds himself in battle with the king of the valley's population of giant insects, an enormous spider (spiders are actually arachnids, not insects, but the two are nevertheless close relatives).

They still manage to summon Godzilla to the island, and upon arriving, the Kaiju King battles and defeats the organization's large military arsenal.

The crew then discovers that numerous icebergs are present, and the water levels are dropping at an alarming rate due to the freezing of the oceans. The source of the problem is also discovered hidden in one of the icebergs, which turns out to be a spaceship containing an advanced race of cold temperature dwelling, semi-humanoid hostile aliens referred to as the Ice People, who hail from the frigid asteroid Frios.\n\nBy using their ultra-sophisticated magnetic wave generators, the Ice People declare to the Calico crew their intentions to direct Frios to Earth, thereby causing the planet to enter a new Ice Age to make the world more palatable to the aliens for future conquest [actually, bringing such a large asteroid near the Earth would cause far more damage than a","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":5246,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 2","overview":"","id":15189,"poster_path":"/s8YAUedHrxthY4xZfc9ZZcAUJbx.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0}}}
