The show follows a team of investigators, led by former FBI agent Ben Hansen, who review various photographs and viral videos of alleged paranormal activity. If a particular piece of evidence is deemed intriguing enough to warrant further investigation, they set out to recreate and explain the sighting.\n\nBeginning episode #207 in first-half of season two, the show began to feature a \"You Decide\" segment in the middle of the program where a video is shown of something strange and then asks the viewing audience if they think the footage is fact or faked. After a commercial break the truth behind the video is revealed.","popularity":6.59,"poster_path":"/lYNYf4rMcWhu7v2O6qdnaOkhLYN.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":16679,"logo_path":null,"name":"BASE Productions","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2010-07-15","episode_count":12,"id":44393,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/y88kfqY8wmGW2l6Y8HmpZMkVqsz.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2011-03-23","episode_count":24,"id":44394,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/vjLiu3zGbJ7C5bwkDRce9C8RtJZ.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2012-04-17","episode_count":12,"id":44395,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":3,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Espa√±ol"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Reality","vote_average":5.8,"vote_count":16,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5258a805760ee346616baad3","air_date":"2010-07-15","episodes":[{"air_date":"2010-07-15","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":774738,"name":"Burning Rubber / Hyperjump","overview":"The team investigates stories of a ghost car which was seen by a policeman driving through a chainlink fence, and apparent UFOs that were filmed flying through the Arizona desert skies.","production_code":"","runtime":43,"season_number":1,"show_id":33168,"still_path":"/yztOK6wIHXay6xCuaaapYqLXH5E.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-07-22","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":774743,"name":"Unwanted Visitors / Strange Sightings","overview":"The team splits up to investigate yet another group of Arizona UFO sightings (this time, near Lake Havasu); in addition to a pair of Tall Skinny Things caught on night-vision video by a Fresno, California, homeowner.","production_code":"","runtime":43,"season_number":1,"show_id":33168,"still_path":"/yk8PQhCMHiwRJl0BBlRnP2Qw2nv.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-07-29","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":774742,"name":"Off the Deep End / Houseguest","overview":"Ben, Jael and Austin investigate Pennsylvania's version of the Loch Ness Monster, while Bill, Chi-Lan and Larry travel to California, where a man claims that a ghost communicates with him through messages which mysteriously appear on Polaroid photographs taken within his home.","production_code":"","runtime":43,"season_number":1,"show_id":33168,"still_path":"/ezfUOnPbgBRfcOya6w25f8Ms8Dx.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-08-05","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":774739,"name":"Predator / Red Sky At Night","overview":"A predator is caught on video in Dartmoor, U.K.; sightings of a large triangular aircraft over El Cajon, Cal., pique the interest of the UFO community.","production_code":"","runtime":43,"season_number":1,"show_id":33168,"still_path":"/2jpmbkO1U8GtoJ9KdNxg2jxgPry.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-08-12","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":774737,"name":"Blazing Horizon / Rollover","overview":"Bill, Austin and Jael travel to Michigan to look into the mysterious \"Paulding Lights\", while Ben, Larry and Chi-Lan head to San Antonio, Texas, where ghostly children are said to push cars over the railroad tracks where they themselves met their fatal end.","production_code":"","runtime":43,"season_number":1,"show_id":33168,"still_path":"/vq6S4IzgaHgQTj3RJ0sZ8gF9rf5.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-08-19","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":774740,"name":"The Caretaker / Cutter","overview":"The team splits up, with Ben, Jael and Austin investigating an alleged ghost of a Civil War deserter videoed in an Indiana cemetery, while Bill, Chi-Lan and Larry head to Colorado where livestock are being mutilated by an unknown predator, while strange lights appear in the night sky.","production_code":"","runtime":43,"season_number":1,"show_id":33168,"still_path":"/s3ZI1zolmZuMJ8lMBrP406mkPVu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-10-28","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":774741,"name":"Haunted Mansion Mist / Starlight Intruder","overview":"Ben, Chi-Lan and Austin travel to Alton, Illinois to investigate the McPike Mansion, a well known haunted house where some local ghost hunters caught what appears to be an apparition on their cameras.

The bedroom has since been converted to an office, but JoMarie arranges the space so that Bill, Devin, and Lanisha can build a model bed and run some experiments with the original camera used.\n\nThe first experiment is a simple lever that will lift Lanisha up from underneath, making it look like a force is suspending her by her torso. The movement is wrong, however, and Lanisha has to strain and use her muscles in order to make it look smooth. Next, they try a cantilever arm, which is the mechanism magicians use to make it look like people are levitating. The movement still looks choppy, and the direction of the force is wrong. The only choice is to build a multiple anchor point pulley system.\n\nAfter hours of work, Lanisha lies down in the rig as Devin and Bill work the pulleys and lift her off the bed. It's an excellent match ‚Äì the movement, the positioning - the only problem is the visibility of the wires, but with a little video manipulation, they're able to make the wires disappear. Additionally, voice analysis of Diane reveals high stress levels, indicating a hoax.\n\nThe next case regards superhuman abilities. Wim Hof, a Dutch man known as The Ice Man, has been setting records for years for his ability to endure extreme cold, including submerging himself in a tub of ice on a crowded New York City street, and running a half marathon near the arctic circle. Ben, Jael, and Austin all find it difficult to believe, so they set up a tank filled halfway with a material called polysorb II, a powder which, when mixed with water, looks like ice but is nowhere near as cold. But when they fill the rest of the tank with ice, it's clear that any passerby would have noted the difference.\n\nNext, Ben and Austin run, shirtless and barefoot, around an ice rink in an attempt to recreate Wim's arctic run. But, they only last a few minutes before frostbite and mild hypothermia set in. The Ice Man has bested them on two tests so far - it's time to meet him in person.\n\nWim tells them that, over years of training, he's been able to condition the muscles that control his blood vessels to relax in extreme situations, making him impervious to cold. He and Austin go head-to-head in their own tanks of ice, with a medic close by to monitor their temperature and heart rates. After about five minutes, Austin's vital signs start to fluctuate, while Wim's hold steady.
