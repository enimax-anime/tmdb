After five happy years of marriage in New York with Alberto and their young son, Anna Ribera returns to Spain to take her project Velvet to the next level. She and Alberto had been managing all things Velvet from across the ocean and, together with their best friends and partners, had made a name for Velvet as the number one address in the world of fashion and innovation. Now they decide to take the next step and turn their reputation into a franchise, first at home, then abroad. The first step is opening shop in the other great Spanish city, Barcelona, on its world famous promenade, the Passeig de Gracia. There, the second Velvet Fashion Store is about to open its gates, managed by Ana's good friend Clara who had made it up the career ladder from seamstress to directorial assistant in the Madrid Velvet years.","popularity":26.031,"poster_path":"/dYrLZbWKKSUECCQ5CCvpEm6HZma.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":67412,"logo_path":"/vgVqq5hunVs8GN5Je9d9rG7Q2NU.png","name":"Movistar+","origin_country":"ES"},{"id":27628,"logo_path":"/8rluD2KhZHZbEOiAKW5qbBxyD0R.png","name":"Bambú Producciones","origin_country":"ES"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"ES","name":"Spain"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2019-12-19","episode_count":1,"id":138574,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/zvEUTOcjDV9FX1NzTIjSf4VTRE3.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2017-09-22","episode_count":10,"id":93002,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/gxaVd7JkgEzndJKY0jsSSY20BXA.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"2018-09-12","episode_count":10,"id":109239,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/pdYBI3Jf0SfsytIrIELPtBRgNaW.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"Spanish","iso_639_1":"es","name":"Español"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.2,"vote_count":20,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"59c367839251415b5400c952","air_date":"2017-09-22","episodes":[{"air_date":"2017-09-22","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1369075,"name":"New Horizons","overview":"The day after Ana and her friends give a VIP investor a tour of the new Velvet store in Barcelona, a shocking loss puts a damper on the grand opening.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":74024,"still_path":"/zLvN9gArzXk2fPRfhZwJLHjGDNC.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5c0cf3cb9251414f2900b99a","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1006109,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Gustavo Ron","original_name":"Gustavo Ron","popularity":2.366,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Ana Rivera","credit_id":"5c0feb2a925141479a0dc7dd","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":225946,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Paula Echevarría","original_name":"Paula Echevarría","popularity":7.091,"profile_path":"/m05YTouZ9NAnJIxd2BgF7rA1wAc.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2017-09-29","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1373180,"name":"Much more than a memory","overview":"After a suspicious Ana hears out Sergio's claims, Doña Blanca tells her of past events kept secret.
