The series follows a brash NYPD detective who goes to London when one of his cases goes sour and remains to work with New Scotland Yard. The basic premise of the show bears a close resemblance to the popular 1980s British series Dempsey & Makepeace, the only notable difference being that the female partner has been replaced by a female housemate. Stylistically, the series derived inspiration from British feature films by Guy Ritchie, such as Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch. The soundtrack and incidental music for the first episode was provided by British techno duo Orbital. Daniel Ash of Love and Rockets scored the rest of the series.","popularity":5.104,"poster_path":"/tURkYcFRI0k82PR4Gzj5RWGoeEb.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2003-06-03","episode_count":13,"id":4806,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/iJmBAnWKf3Kp2zwH48hAfy3yveK.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"New York cop.
