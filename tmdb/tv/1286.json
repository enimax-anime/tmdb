If both combat robots are still operational at the end of the match the winner is determined by a point system based on damage, aggression, and strategy.\n\nThe television show BattleBots aired on the American cable network Comedy Central for five seasons, covering five BattleBots tournaments. The first season aired starting in August 2000, and the fifth season aired starting in August 2002. Hosts of BattleBots were Bil Dwyer and Sean Salisbury and correspondents included former Baywatch actresses Donna D'Errico, Carmen Electra, and Traci Bingham, former Playboy Playmate Heidi Mark, and identical twins Randy and Jason Sklar. Bill Nye was the show's \"technical expert\".\n\nAfter five 'seasons', Comedy Central terminated their contract with BattleBots Inc. in late
