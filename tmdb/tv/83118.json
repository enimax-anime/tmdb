Moving on, the trio dig for clams on the Pacific coast, take a hot-air ride to a vineyard and visit a factory in Chinatown where fortune cookies are made. It seems a competition is in order and so the travel companions see who can make the most cookies in 60 seconds.",

There's a break for a bit of skinny dipping, before the trio fish go fishing, and stay in a strange cabin deep in the woods, surviving on beans and bourbon. They then hit the state capital of Austin, dressing as cowboys in the local bar and at the rodeo, before one last barbecue supper of slow-smoked beef brisket, pork ribs and spicy sausage.",
