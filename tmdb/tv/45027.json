It is judged and executive-produced by Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman, best known for hosting the science entertainment series MythBusters.\n\nPremiered on March 18, 2012, the series pits two teams of various backgrounds against each other to build an elaborate chain reaction contraption. Teams are provided with identical sets of tools and materials and are given five days to construct a series of mechanisms based on a pre-determined theme. Midway through each week, the teams are provided with a surprise \"missing link\" item that they must add to the middle of their machines. The winner is selected by Savage, Hyneman, and a guest judge.","popularity":2.507,"poster_path":"/9JBOMIVDASFg8pfbAU0Fh4oIL6e.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2012-03-18","episode_count":6,"id":65860,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6,"vote_count":2,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"552aa3c7c3a3681f5c00472a","air_date":"2012-03-18","episodes":[{"air_date":"2012-03-18","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1053511,"name":"Heavy vs. Light","overview":"Adam and Jamie challenge electronics experts and set carpenters to build the most creative multi-step \"heavy-vs-light\" themed machine.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":45027,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-03-25","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1053507,"name":"Fire and Ice","overview":"Rocket scientists and special-effects artists go head-to-head in their effort to build the very best fire-and-ice themed machine.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":45027,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-04-01","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":1053509,"name":"Speed","overview":"Horror movie-effects specialists battle motorcycle mechanics in the fight to build the meanest speed-themed machine.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":45027,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2012-04-08","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":1053508,"name":"Take Flight","overview":"A team of engineers goes up against a group of artists in this flight-themed build.
