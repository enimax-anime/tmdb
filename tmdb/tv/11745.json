The next scene finds Tony and the man, who he later finds out is named George, in a hospital room, Tony with a few bruises and George with amnesia. When the pursuers find George at the hospital, Tony rescues him and brings him to his friend, Max Pomeroy. Showing him a few pictures, Tony and Max are able to jog George's memory about an acquaintance, racecar driver Tim Dunnagin, whom George immediately runs out to see. Dunnagin reminds George that they were involved in a robbery 30 years earlier and that $1.6 million worth of loot is still hidden. Only George will be able to remember where it is--if he is able to get his memory back--but Dunnagin can be ruthless as well as impatient.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":11745,"still_path":"/7lOHqTFjB4tcu3tfMZNyV0Q44ST.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"525814cc19c29531db49e23d","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":1218841,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Marion Hargrove","original_name":"Marion Hargrove","popularity":1.039,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525814cc19c29531db49e251","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":95148,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Sutton Roley","original_name":"Sutton Roley","popularity":2.599,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"George Blaisdell","credit_id":"6462f3d08c44b978071ed00f","order":531,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23586,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Joe Flynn","original_name":"Joe Flynn","popularity":4.397,"profile_path":"/km1TY2ieAp51uKLDBNUEANvUmaq.jpg"},{"character":"Dr. Nora Zabriskie","credit_id":"6462f44ddbbb4200e22e0f57","order":532,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":16102,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yvonne Craig","original_name":"Yvonne Craig","popularity":6.458,"profile_path":"/8v58DlalM8mpMpE4p5sqPUrOkLV.jpg"},{"character":"Timothy Dunagan","credit_id":"6462f4958c44b978071ed08b","order":533,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2081,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"George Murdock","original_name":"George Murdock","popularity":3.223,"profile_path":"/5XkkbGKbxjlUOKKizifhH0kwYhh.jpg"},{"character":"Jonathan Gordon","credit_id":"6462f4c5ef8b320172d66101","order":534,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":70775,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Hal Williams","original_name":"Hal Williams","popularity":4.383,"profile_path":"/giUDABrrTa52iTyTgymD8LNBMyC.jpg"},{"character":"Betty Foster","credit_id":"6462f52ba67254014367e8fd","order":535,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":34516,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Pamela Britton","original_name":"Pamela Britton","popularity":2.141,"profile_path":"/dRDBaqZRfyKFSiBf5ZgbM6sVFuY.jpg"},{"character":"Stan Lubie","credit_id":"6462f54eef8b32011b150b24","order":536,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":151547,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Milford","original_name":"John Milford","popularity":5.876,"profile_path":"/ii3TWeydkcRO3UboUhjpcdH599P.jpg"},{"character":"Father Fred","credit_id":"6462f56ee3fa2f0187b989cd","order":537,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87520,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Yuki Shimoda","original_name":"Yuki Shimoda","popularity":1.84,"profile_path":"/8ljPssO2nDpJqdvG1Y23bRbyNDa.jpg"},{"character":"Alex Nicholson","credit_id":"6462f5920f365500e20c80a5","order":538,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":136129,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Russell Thorson","original_name":"Russell Thorson","popularity":3.798,"profile_path":"/tfdF9MqCzGVzHpDDsLaWgL1Vo1Q.jpg"},{"character":"Connie (uncredited)","credit_id":"6464cf2df48b3401384bc295","order":621,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1131109,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cami Sebring","original_name":"Cami Sebring","popularity":1.4,"profile_path":"/cn0cFePNwNHUVilSspkDZk8fyKC.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1973-12-18","episode_number":9,"episode_type":"standard","id":463805,"name":"Nightmare in Steel","overview":"A band of modern-day pirates is seeking to hijack a tanker ship for its $4 million worth of fuel.
