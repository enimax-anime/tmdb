Named for the nearby Nandi tribe, which claims to have hunted the animal, the story of the vicious Nandi Bear has existed in African folklore for more than one hundred years. Recently, there seems to been a new rash of Nandi Bear sightings in Kenya's Rift Valley. The question is: are the villagers seeing the mysterious Nandi Bear, or something else?","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":4,"show_id":4706,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-09-16","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":341756,"name":"Spirits of Angkor Wat / Canadian Lake Monster","overview":"By day, the 800-year-old temple known as Angkor Wat is one of Cambodia's most treasured national landmarks and tourist attractions but, by night, could it be ground zero for the region's angriest spirits? That's certainly the belief of many visitors to Angkor, a sprawling forty square mile complex of stone palaces, shrines, and ruins. In the center of this compound sits Angkor Wat, a 12th century structure originally designed as a Hindu temple, which now holds the distinction of being the largest religious building in the world. Equally impressive is the massive, 600-foot wide moat that separates Angkor from the mainland. Might this moat be an ancient attempt to keep the bad spirits away from the local people? Sounds like a case for Team Truth.\n\nA 36-year-old fisherman just vanished in Canada's Okanagan Lake. Even worse, this is but one in a string of disappearances reported to have occurred in the same area of this body of water. The local rumor mill has it that all of these disappearances are the deadly handiwork of the Ogopogo, a huge amphibious beast, which has been documented in the annals of Canadian history for the past 1,000 years. The epicenter of Ogopogo sightings is the ominously named Rattlesnake Island, a small rock outcropping in the lake. Someone has to get to the bottom of this.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":4,"show_id":4706,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-09-23","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":341757,"name":"Ghosts of Haboro / Mngwa of Tanzania","overview":"Near Haboro, a coal-mining town on an island in northern Japan, thousands of miners died while working under sub-standard conditions. Some were prisoners of war who were worked to death, while others were buried alive. In the forty years since these mines were closed, nearby residents have reported strange paranormal activity leading them to think the area is haunted.\n\nIn Tanzania, a mysterious beast is said to be roaming through the flat lands of the Serengeti.

Located halfway between the Philippines and Hawaii near the Chuuk Islands, this lagoon offers some of the best wreck diving in the world. Once the site of a decisive battle between Japan and United States during World War II, there are numerous ships, planes, tanks, and submarines that have been resting here since they were shot down nearly 70 years ago. Now, divers and locals claim that the ghosts of these soldiers haunt the waters around the wreckage.\n\nIn northern Japan, you'll find many children's lunchboxes decorated with a cute, green reptile on the side. That animal, called a Kappa, was once feared as an evil cross between a demon and a turtle before it became something of a national mascot. Recently, however, a new spate of ominous sightings has given rise to rumors that the Kappa has returned and is responsible for missing livestock and even children.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":4,"show_id":4706,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2010-10-07","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":341759,"name":"Siberian Snowman","overview":"Up in the icy mountains of Siberia in southern Russia, there have been a rash of recent sightings of a beast known as the Siberian Snowman.

Battle cries, shadows, and strange noises are all reported to emanate from the center of what's called the Menengai Crater.\n\nCould Madagascar be the home to a small but dangerous creature called the Kalanoro? That idea might not be too far fetched since this island off the coast of Africa is the home to several animals that are not found anywhere else in the world.

A little research by the team revealed that there are centuries-old stories about floating lights and moving shadows at the site.\n\nIf you're visiting northern Morocco, you just might hear someone talking about Aisha Kandisha, \"the devil temptress.\" Although her name doesn't sound particularly threatening, this beautiful, nocturnal succubus is said to have been luring local men to their death for years.
