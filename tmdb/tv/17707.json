The one who eluded the bounty hunters the longest would receive a cash prize.\n\nManhunt was plagued with problems during its brief run. First, a deal collapsed with the World Wrestling Federation in which a number of their \"superstars\" were to be a part of the show's cast. Then, the bottom fell out when separate investigative reports by conspiracy theorist Peter Lance and game-show enthusiast Steve Beverly revealed that the show was being filmed at Griffith Park in Los Angeles, California. Manhunt had claimed to be filmed on location in Hawaii.\n\nThe program was pulled after six episodes.\n\nJohn Cena and former American Gladiator Raye \"Zap\" Hollitt were among the cast members.
