With the aid of \"NerveGear\" technology, players can control their avatars within the game using nothing but their own thoughts.\n\nKazuto Kirigaya is among the lucky few who get their hands on the first shipment. He logs in to find himself, with ten-thousand others, in the scenic and elaborate world of Aincrad. However, in a cruel turn of events, the players soon realize they cannot log out; the game's creator has trapped them in his new world until they complete all one hundred levels of the game.\n\nIn order to escape Aincrad, Kirito will now have to interact and cooperate with his fellow players. Some are allies, while others are foes. Sword Art Online is not all fun and games: if they die in Aincrad, they die in real life. Kirito must adapt to his new reality, fight for his survival, and hopefully break free from his virtual hell.","id":54255,"poster_path":"/xMybvQFv4XOwqRTgkmvIrclPhD4.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7.7},"2":{"_id":"53d375c2c3a3686b9a000ef4","air_date":"2014-07-05","episodes":[{"air_date":"2014-07-05","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1001054,"name":"The World of Guns","overview":"A year has passed since SAO was cleared.

He works there as a part-time employee to test the system's capabilities in  realm generated by the Soul Translator. As per the confidentiality contract, any memories created by the machine in the virtual world are wiped upon returning to the real world.

Kazuto is mortally wounded in the ensuing fight and loses consciousness. When he comes to, he discovers that he has made a full-dive into the Underworld with seemingly no way to escape.

the Axiom Church—things have not seemed to calm down yet. Upon contacting the real world, Kazuto \"Kirito\" Kirigaya finds out that the Ocean Turtle—a mega-float controlled by Rath—was raided. Due to a sudden short-circuit caused by the raiders, Kirito's fluctlight is damaged, leaving him comatose. Feeling insecure about the people at the Axiom Church, Alice brings the unconscious Kirito back to their hometown—Rulid Village, disregarding her banishment due to an unabsolved crime. Now, Alice is living an ordinary and peaceful life close by the village, wishing for Kirito to wake up.\n\nHowever, tragedy strikes when Alice notices that the Dark Territory has already started to invade the Human Empire. Reassuming her previous alias, Alice Synthesis Thirty, she promises to defeat the Dark Territory in order to defend the world that Kirito and Eugeo worked so hard to protect.","id":132606,"poster_path":"/aaa62CnA8wJLkGu0KHhg8TKxSPq.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":8.6}}}
