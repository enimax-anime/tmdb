In the UK it was seen on ITV and in the US in syndication. The format uses puppets in a technique called supermarionation, a name that was first seen in the closing titles of the last 13 episodes.\n\nThe plot of the show consisted of Supercar, a vertical takeoff and landing craft invented by Rudolph Popkiss and Horatio Beaker, and piloted by Mike Mercury. On land it rode on a cushion of air rather than wheels. Jets in the rear allowed it to fly like a jet and retractable wings were incorporated in the back of the car. Retrorockets on the side of the car slowed the vehicle. The car used \"Clear-Vu\", which included an inside television monitor allowing the occupant to see through fog and smoke. The vehicle was housed in a laboratory and living facility at Black Rock, Nevada, U.S.A. In the show's first episode, \"Rescue\", the Supercar crew's first mission is to save the passengers of a downed private plane. Two of the rescued, young Jimmy Gibson and his pet monkey, Mitch, are invited to live at the facility and share in the adventures.","popularity":5.934,"poster_path":"/1p8435p1O4A0B9lIobNHRVGJFfM.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1961-01-28","episode_count":26,"id":1694,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":6.9},{"air_date":"1962-02-02","episode_count":13,"id":1693,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":6,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5253854019c2957940206a40","air_date":"1961-01-28","episodes":[{"air_date":"1961-01-28","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":31111,"name":"Rescue","overview":"Jimmy Gibson and his older brother Bill are flying to America by plane with Mitch the monkey when their plane crashes.
