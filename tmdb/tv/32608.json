Are these examples of modern technology, or is there evidence that these incredible mechanisms existed on Earth thousands of years ago?",

Ancient astronaut theorists suggest that the standing stones in Carnac, France were used as an ancient GPS system for ancient flying machines. The recently discovered Gobekli Tepe in Turkey, which has been dated back 12,000 years, has finely chiseled pillars that experts describe as a Noah's Ark in stone. Is it possible that extraterrestrials assisted primitive man in constructing these unexplained structures? If so, what was the purpose of these grand projects?",

In recent years, hieroglyphs have been decoded to reveal that the Maya were able to accurately predict shifts in the Earth's axis every 26,000 years. Inscriptions on the sarcophagus of their most prominent ruler, King Pakal, tell of a journey to the Milky Way. And a sophisticated calendar foretells of the end of the world in 2012. Most striking is their belief that knowledge was passed to them by otherworldly beings who descended from the sky.

Why would so many different cultures share this belief that mountains had a connection to otherworldly beings? The Greeks believed their most powerful gods, the Olympians, waged an epic war for control of the universe from Mt. Olympus. Ruins of a 4000-year-old observatory discovered on a mountain in Macedonia reveal that the ancients tracked celestial movements from on high with remarkable precision. And in Peru, the descendants of the Incans continue an ancient pilgrimage tradition in order to commune with mountain spirits known as Apu. Could these gods have been extraterrestrials? Did they use remote mountain peaks to interact with early man? Might this explain why humans have been drawn to mountains for thousands of years?",

The ancient Egyptians believed mummification ensured entrance into the next life. Buddhist monks in Japan practiced a shocking self-mummification process that began before death in the hopes of becoming a \"living Buddha.\" And the Incas consulted the mummified remains of their kings to discuss affairs of state and the future. Ancient Astronaut theorists believe the global practice of mummification is not a coincidence, but proof that highly advanced extraterrestrials visited Earth in the distant past. Could our ancestors have witnessed a form of biological hibernation and then mimicked it with mummification? Could mummification have been an attempt to recreate suspended animation so often connected to extraterrestrial space travel? Or could the intention have been to preserve the body for future DNA removal?",

Archaeologists now believe the ancient pyramids in Peru are older than the Egyptian pyramids, and a recently surveyed megalithic site in Indonesia is now suspected to be a step pyramid built by a long lost civilization 20,000 years ago.

Greek stories dating to 2000 B.C. tell of the god Hephaestus creating robots to build weapons, as well as the bronze giant Talos. In Egypt, the Pyramid Texts say that the god Osiris was dismembered, then reassembled and brought back to life just like a machine. If sophisticated robots really did exist in the ancient world--what function did they serve? Who built them? And what happened to them?",

In recent years, more new evidence has been revealed than ever before that suggests there was extraterrestrial intervention on Earth in the distant past. Satellite images have exposed geoglyphs resembling Nazca lines in Kazakhstan. Ground penetrating radar has detected remnants of ancient technology in Machu Picchu. And thermal scanning has uncovered hidden chambers behind King Tut's tomb that may hold the remains of extraterrestrial beings.

Could the alien abduction phenomenon be true? But if so, why are people being taken? And perhaps more importantly--why are they being returned? Stories of human abduction by otherworldly entities can be found in mythologies dating back thousands of years, and the abductees often return to Earth with new knowledge or instructions for mankind. In modern times, researchers of alleged alien abductions have found extraterrestrial objects implanted just under the skin, strange patterns in genetic mutations, and knowledge of entire alien languages from abductees. Is it possible that extraterrestrials are secretly manipulating mankind through these abduction events?",

The megalithic Kailasa Temple dedicated to Lord Shiva is carved from a single rock cliff, and it is said that it took just 18 years to chisel out the estimated 400,000 tons of rock excavated in its construction. But how was this accomplished over a thousand years ago when modern engineers say such a feat is not even possible with today's technology?",

Starting around 1947, a series of unexplained sightings and mysterious events forced certain high-level members within the US government to officially become alien hunters. Projects Sign, Grudge, and Bluebook were government programs to research UFO sightings--and by some accounts, literally hundreds of the reported events were unable to be explained. Ancient Astronaut theorists suggest there is evidence that similar endeavors were even made thousands of years ago, sighting ancient astronomical observatories found all over the world, and new evidence that Babylonians were tracking the movements of the planets over 2,000 years ago.",

This document is purported to be a memo sent from the director of the CIA in 1952 to president-elect Dwight Eisenhower, informing him of the existence of a top-secret group within the US government called \"The Majestic Twelve.\" Composed of top scientists, government officials, and military elite, this group's mission was to investigate reports of unidentified flying objects--and to examine crashed extraterrestrial craft. And more recently, in 2002, a major computer hack into Pentagon and NASA computers appears to reveal hard evidence that not only are the Majestic Twelve documents real, but that the government's interaction with extraterrestrials has led to the creation of a secret space program, that has already established bases on the moon, Mars, and other celestial bodies.",

But if true, where do these individuals get their visions? According to ancient mythologies, there is a universal repository of knowledge known as the Akashic Record. While most mainstream scholars relegate this to the realm of mythology, recent scientific discoveries have opened the possibility that such a repository could actually exist--and is accessible by the human mind. Giorgio A. Tsoukalos meets with neuroscientist Dr. Dario Nardi to measure the brainwaves of Dr. Deepak Chopra as he enters a state of deep meditation to observe the physical chnges in the brain as he connects or taps into something beyond ourselves. Could our ability to tap into the Akashic Record lead to the next giant leap in human evolution--and connect us to other intelligent beings throughout the cosmos?",

Tsoukalos travels to India to further explore the Sanskrit texts, as well as the structures and technology that have stood the test of time. From a temple that inexplicably survived a major earthquake to evidence of ancient brain surgery and instructions for advanced flying machines, Giorgio studies the sacred knowledge that is said to have come directly from the voices of the gods.",

Could it be that intelligent alien life looks much different from us, and that some extraterrestrials more closely resemble other animals? And is it possible that many of the animals that roam the Earth have otherworldly origins? By examining ancient cultures around the world, we find that nearly all revered certain animals and depicted their gods with animal traits. The Sanskrit epics of India feature gods in the form of elephants, monkeys, and snakes. The Sumerians depicted gods with bird heads and wings. And in Egypt, not only did they portray many of the gods with animal features, but they even went so far as to mummify their animals. Ancient Astronaut theorists suggest that certain animals may not have developed through Darwinian evolution, but were planted here by alien visitors.",

Ancient Astronaut Theorists suggest that not only does reincarnation exist, but our extraterrestrial ancestors specifically designed the human body to be a vessel for otherworldly entities. World leaders, like the Dalai Lama and even Saddam Hussein, claim to be the reincarnations of powerful figures from the past–figures with an extraterrestrial connection. If souls are indeed recycling through various embodiments, is this simply the natural continuation of life–or might this process be directed towards some greater end?

Ishi-no-Hoden is just one of numerous megalithic structures found throughout Japan commemorating a time when the gods--or, perhaps, extraterrestrial beings--descended to Earth. Centuries old texts describe in vivid diagrams strange craft that have appeared in the sky and on the shores. And satellite images of Mars have revealed keyhole-shaped structures identical to some of Japan's oldest tombs.
