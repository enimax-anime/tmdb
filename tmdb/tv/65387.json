The series will reflect what Khloé does at her own home: hosting meals, sharing opinions and experiences, encouraging fun and honesty, and inviting friends to join the party. Taped in Los Angeles, the non-traditional set for Kocktails with Khloé is designed to replicate a true, intimate home environment; as such, it will feature a functional kitchen, dining area and living spaces – but it will not include a studio audience. In each episode, celebrity guests – including Khloé's friends and family – will join her in the kitchen and around the table for a lively dinner party where engaging and relevant conversations will pair with cooking, party games and, of course, Kocktails. Adding to the elegant and fun party atmosphere will be Chef Sharone Hakman who will collaborate on menus and assist in entertaining.","popularity":6.052,"poster_path":"/g6kzfVC7ZBkv5jNNzRyom5esgn8.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26420,"logo_path":"/sbX5PhK6b3eshMYUkUq1MhtaRLk.png","name":"Pilgrim Media Group","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"2016-01-20","episode_count":14,"id":74066,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/g6kzfVC7ZBkv5jNNzRyom5esgn8.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Canceled","tagline":"","type":"Reality","vote_average":6.8,"vote_count":20,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"56a2f3659251411e1500032f","air_date":"2016-01-20","episodes":[{"air_date":"2016-01-20","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1160524,"name":"The Happiest Hour","overview":"Tonight's guests include: Snoop Dogg, Kendall Jenner, Aisha Tyler (co-host of The Talk), Brandi Glanville (The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills) and Kym Whitley (Raising Whitley and Young & Hungry).","production_code":"","runtime":42,"season_number":1,"show_id":65387,"still_path":"/3ZZPYMPu0VmcTn1OY3zLYZUIwl1.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d21ea3b7eb5f200104ea4f9","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":19767,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Snoop Dogg","original_name":"Snoop Dogg","popularity":14.471,"profile_path":"/rbxBK2m6fEq0oHeMoBUMVYkJEdJ.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d21ea497eb5f200124e9bad","order":501,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1549005,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kendall Jenner","original_name":"Kendall Jenner","popularity":13.436,"profile_path":"/f2LQHjGyTkZVi1RS3qhjSpnb6hG.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d21ea57f495ee001437099d","order":502,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":38674,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Aisha Tyler","original_name":"Aisha Tyler","popularity":12.583,"profile_path":"/gVvqznx4udJMgO86IbufADinfE9.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d21f24b6d4c97000e75b5f8","order":503,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1686599,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Brandi Glanville","original_name":"Brandi Glanville","popularity":3.622,"profile_path":"/qwtUwBW7QUfQp0OEpHppBj5VyOF.jpg"},{"character":"Self","credit_id":"5d21f25094d8a8049a43c32b","order":504,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":80597,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kym Whitley","original_name":"Kym Whitley","popularity":9.081,"profile_path":"/kWo5pJe9Ogi3YQAocVoDMP1Sndj.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2016-01-27","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":1161791,"name":"Bottoms Up!","overview":"Khloé Kardashian is joined by Tyga, Scott Disick, Malika Haqq, Jenna Mourey (YouTube personality, Jenna Marbles) and Morgan Stewart (\"#RichKids of Beverly Hills\") to dish on their lives, pop culture, fashion, celebrity gossip and more.
