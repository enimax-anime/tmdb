He finds Mieze, but she disappears from his arms. Reinhold is in prison for the crimes committed by a man whose identity he has acquired. He is anguished that his cellmate and lover is being released. Franz is taken to an asylum. Much of the rest of the episode takes place in his imagination. Franz’s being run over by the car is re-enacted with different characters taking on the roles of victim and driver. In a striking sequence, Franz and Mieze are treated like animals being slaughtered in an abattoir. On a nativity set Franz is raised on a cross as the other characters watch. An atom bomb goes off in the background and the angels clear the dead. The surreal imagery ceases suddenly and Franz is at Reinhold’s trial testifying to his good character. Reinhold is given ten years for manslaughter. Eva tells Franz she has lost the baby. The film concludes with Franz as an assistant gatekeeper at a factory. He is alert to his job but not to what is going on in the world as war is on the horizon.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"1980-12-29","episode_number":14,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":43189,"still_path":"/wMRpSUqgO0QrLoq9BtixY22xK4Q.jpg"},"name":"Berlin Alexanderplatz","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":308,"logo_path":"/fc0O0mvjl8PbHgZXXY2VgPYos1Z.png","name":"ARD","origin_country":"DE"}],"number_of_episodes":14,"number_of_seasons":1,"origin_country":["DE"],"original_language":"de","original_name":"Berlin Alexanderplatz","overview":"In late 1920s Berlin, Franz Biberkopf is released from prison and vows to go straight.

He finds Mieze, but she disappears from his arms. Reinhold is in prison for the crimes committed by a man whose identity he has acquired. He is anguished that his cellmate and lover is being released. Franz is taken to an asylum. Much of the rest of the episode takes place in his imagination. Franz’s being run over by the car is re-enacted with different characters taking on the roles of victim and driver. In a striking sequence, Franz and Mieze are treated like animals being slaughtered in an abattoir. On a nativity set Franz is raised on a cross as the other characters watch. An atom bomb goes off in the background and the angels clear the dead. The surreal imagery ceases suddenly and Franz is at Reinhold’s trial testifying to his good character. Reinhold is given ten years for manslaughter. Eva tells Franz she has lost the baby. The film concludes with Franz as an assistant gatekeeper at a factory. He is alert to his job but not to what is going on in the world as war is on the horizon.","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":43189,"still_path":"/wMRpSUqgO0QrLoq9BtixY22xK4Q.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5f14734865c26c0038c1f9a2","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Werner Fassbinder","original_name":"Rainer Werner Fassbinder","popularity":4.497,"profile_path":"/baO8IR7Oyi2yP6La33Ic45kiq37.jpg"},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5f1473701c6aa700368068c1","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2725,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Rainer Werner Fassbinder","original_name":"Rainer Werner Fassbinder","popularity":4.497,"profile_path":"/baO8IR7Oyi2yP6La33Ic45kiq37.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":52647,"poster_path":"/x42HpsYrkIyOaz9HMcEu8mLdy3i.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":0}}}
