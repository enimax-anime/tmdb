Naturally, he keeps his opinions to himself, but as Party Whip, his support is valuable, and he is courted by all the candidates. He must tread warily, as supporting the loser could cost him his position.

Meanwhile, it might be a good idea to surreptitiously undermine the leader and start maneuvering in his own favor. And, as luck would have it, an inexperienced young journalist, Mattie Storin, is innocently hanging on his every word. He pretends to be helping her learn about Westminster politics, instead he uses her to leak damaging stories about his rivals. As the Party gathers for its annual conference, the scandals begin to break.","production_code":"","runtime":58,"season_number":1,"show_id":21720,"still_path":"/3ygB1xrrwrkMdIkGO4PLvFm0U3d.jpg","vote_average":9,"vote_count":3,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52586aef760ee346611b32ac","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":9156,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Andrew Davies","original_name":"Andrew Davies","popularity":6.565,"profile_path":"/gOxUTVdqNinS2KQvEyIAMKPKt6s.jpg"},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52586aef760ee346611b32c4","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":87103,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Seed","original_name":"Paul Seed","popularity":1.863,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"52586af0760ee346611b346d","order":501,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":26679,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Damien Thomas","original_name":"Damien Thomas","popularity":1.626,"profile_path":"/zeZPHD7twbeSo6VnPhsZn1o7gAb.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"52586aef760ee346611b33dc","order":503,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":39066,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Villiers","original_name":"James Villiers","popularity":2.286,"profile_path":"/4Q3T9KYj6fV8CpR9y8BOAAA1UAz.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"52586af0760ee346611b348f","order":504,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1212895,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Richard Braine","original_name":"Richard Braine","popularity":1.742,"profile_path":null},{"character":"","credit_id":"52586af0760ee346611b3408","order":505,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":153181,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John Arnatt","original_name":"John Arnatt","popularity":1.908,"profile_path":"/tT3RZmCO2SDZ9vkZLpW35i9QJGl.jpg"},{"character":"","credit_id":"52586af0760ee346611b3434","order":507,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":110072,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kenny Ireland","original_name":"Kenny Ireland","popularity":2.852,"profile_path":"/btJ6279IAHs9ApuGgZ7JlSjHcCo.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"1990-12-02","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":599347,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"Collingridge is in deep political trouble and he has no alternative but to step down as Prime Minister.
