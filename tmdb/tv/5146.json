Surveillance cameras at a Minneapolis convenience store capture more than just the shooting. Footage suggests vital DNA may have been left in the store by the shooter himself. Then, surveillance footage in Atlanta shows a man carrying a box moments before he is shot, Detective Tracy Casey must determine if the box's contents holds the key to determining motive. Additional Minneapolis surveillance cameras capture the shooting of a young man in the Cedar-Riverside neighborhood. But detectives need the help of the Somali community to identify the shooters in the video.",
