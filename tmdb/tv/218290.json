As King Mokjong left no heirs from being preoccupied, King Hyeonjong, the last grandson of Taejo of Goryeo, became first in line for succession.\n\nKing Hyeonjong, who had been away from politics and living as a monk, ascended to the throne at 19 years of age due to the rebellion by Kang Cho. The young king faced an invasion by a Khitan army of 400,000 men because of it.\n\nKang Kam-chan, a loyal subject, helped the king during the two wars. The king eventually unified Goryeo with his tolerance and leadership. And Kang Kam-chan annihilated the Khitan army at the Battle of Gwiju in 1018.",
