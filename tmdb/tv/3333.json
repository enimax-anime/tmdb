Corbett who deal in selling used items. They live on Oil Drum Lane, a fictional street in Shepherd's Bush, London. Four series were broadcast by the BBC from 1962 to 1965, followed by a second run from 1970 to 1974. Its theme tune, \"Old Ned\", was composed by Ron Grainer. The series was voted 15th in a 2004 BBC poll to find Britain's Best Sitcom. It was remade in the US as Sanford and Son, in Sweden as Albert & Herbert and in the Netherlands as Stiefbeen en zoon. In 1972 a movie adaptation of the series, Steptoe and Son, was released in cinemas, with a second Steptoe and Son Ride Again in 1973.","popularity":8.625,"poster_path":"/hhpwjPICU1wcUegTFvRCCF9UpKA.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1973-12-24","episode_count":7,"id":10329,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/w45CWbtU7JY3MFDrJ51UXG6eug5.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1962-01-05","episode_count":6,"id":10325,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/zxUCm8ipgxzdMFLrMIwgjy1XaJf.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":7.7},{"air_date":"1963-01-03","episode_count":7,"id":10327,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/dkCsIhYvwuXEJ6kAukB5VBvXAxn.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":7.4},{"air_date":"1964-01-07","episode_count":7,"id":10322,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/1J6TyOyIYoPUyADeVP1jmVcG6Tx.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":7.7},{"air_date":"1965-10-04","episode_count":7,"id":10321,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/5dwnWn1AUWIG3FpVffmKD5iGQEi.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1970-03-06","episode_count":7,"id":10326,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/duoPmkXo9xJfhUt21GwWcE7jVkS.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1970-11-02","episode_count":8,"id":10323,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":"/z7Mp0ERqRrh2ek78ickJoZHoXeF.jpg","season_number":6,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1972-02-21","episode_count":7,"id":10324,"name":"Season 7","overview":"","poster_path":"/vjzdyR7nFTuaLs11QgCpUhv3kIT.jpg","season_number":7,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1974-09-04","episode_count":6,"id":10328,"name":"Season 8","overview":"","poster_path":"/shRQsU34pkIut9LojGR5zwYZvOg.jpg","season_number":8,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7.8,"vote_count":29,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52574f9d760ee36aaa1995e8","air_date":"1962-01-05","episodes":[{"air_date":"1962-01-05","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":245662,"name":"The Offer","overview":"The very first episode of what was to become an all time classic comedy series.
