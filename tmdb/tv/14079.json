Destry was based on the classic James Stewart Western, Destry Rides Again, and a subsequent remake, Destry, starring Audie Murphy.\n\nIn the original films, the main character was Tom Destry, a Western lawman who was a crack shot, but who preferred non-violent solutions to problems with outlaws. In the television series, Gavin played Harrison Destry, son of Tom, who had himself been a lawman until he was framed for a crime and sent to prison. The show followed Harrison Destry upon his release from prison as he wandered the West looking for the people that framed him. Just like the feature films, many comedic situations arose because Destry went to great lengths to avoid violence even though he was always running into trouble.\n\nDestry never caught on with television audiences, especially since the popularity of the Western genre had begun to wane, and the series only lasted for thirteen episodes.\n\nAmong the guest stars were Chris Alcaide, Ron Hayes, Roger Mobley, Stuart Randall, and Barbara Stuart.","popularity":2.256,"poster_path":"/5l3gO7ly7KXzJbc1HIfe5oNdpou.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1964-02-14","episode_count":13,"id":25391,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":5,"vote_count":1,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52582e09760ee36aaa8b2ccf","air_date":"1964-02-14","episodes":[{"air_date":"1964-02-14","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":513338,"name":"The Solid Gold Girl","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":14079,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"52582e09760ee36aaa8b2d10","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14773,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Don Siegel","original_name":"Don Siegel","popularity":7.164,"profile_path":"/wjhr8oJr3fVfOphN7lIlr0R6nF9.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-02-21","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":513337,"name":"Destry Had A Little Lamb","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":14079,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-02-28","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":513336,"name":"Law And Order Day","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":14079,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"The Deputy","credit_id":"60102ee44d0e8d003e7a5cf5","order":501,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":160803,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Ken Drake","original_name":"Ken Drake","popularity":0.772,"profile_path":null}]},{"air_date":"1964-03-06","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":513339,"name":"Stormy Is A Lady","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":14079,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-03-13","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":513343,"name":"The Nicest Girl In Gomorrah","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":14079,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-03-20","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":513341,"name":"Big Deal At Little River","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":14079,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"1964-03-27","episode_number":7,"episode_type":"standard","id":513342,"name":"Go Away, Little Sheba","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":60,"season_number":1,"show_id":14079,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"52582e0a760ee36aaa8b2d60","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15609,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Gene L.
