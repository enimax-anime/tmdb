The series was filmed at Copps Coliseum in Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nThe show starred Michael Riley as Brett Parker, a former New York City sports agent who became the general manager of a National Hockey League franchise, the Hamilton Steelheads.\n\nOne of the throughline plots of the series dealt with Parker's ongoing love–hate relationships with the sport, the team and his superior at McArdle Industries, corporate executive Colleen Blessed, played by Kari Matchett.\n\nThe cast also included Gordon Pinsent as team owner Duff McArdle, Jonathan Crombie, Jennifer Dale and Al Waxman. The show's theme song was a modernized version of the Stompin' Tom Connors classic, \"The Hockey Song\", performed partly by Connors himself, and then transitioning to the performance of the band Rusty.\n\nThe show was briefly aired on the US network UPN, starting in 1999, but was pulled after just two episodes. The second episode aired in the US has the distinction of being the lowest-rated episode of any prime-time TV series ever aired by any US network.","popularity":2.735,"poster_path":null,"production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1998-10-15","episode_count":13,"id":21732,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1999-10-15","episode_count":13,"id":21733,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":10,"vote_count":1,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"52580da619c29531db4290cb","air_date":"1998-10-15","episodes":[{"air_date":"1998-10-15","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":447678,"name":"Perambulate Me Back to My Habitual Abode","overview":"Brett Parker returns to his hometown of Hamilton, Ontario, and is offered the job of general manager to the Hamilton Steelheads after the current one dies.
