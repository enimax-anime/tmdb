Brenda has recently joined LAPD after a long career in law enforcement, including with the Atlanta and Washington, D.C., Police Departments. We soon learn Brenda is originally from Atlanta, Georgia, was CIA-trained, and was recruited by her former married lover, Assistant Chief Will Pope. Brenda is resented as an outsider by much of the LAPD and seen as an adversary by Robbery-Homicide's Captain Taylor, who initially persuades her squad to request transfers en masse in an unsuccessful effort to force Brenda's resignation. Brenda soon wins over her assistant, Sgt. David Gabriel, and the grudging admiration of the team when she shows them why she is called a closer; but her battle is far from over. As the season progresses, we see Brenda struggle to establish her authority and earn the respect of her squad, despite the efforts of Taylor and Detective Lt. Andy Flynn to both undermine her authority and hamper her investigations. Slowly, one-by-one, Brenda wins over her team; and, by season's end, she has earned the loyalty of them all, even the hard-boiled Det. Flynn, as they stand united against Capt. Taylor's final attempt to remove Brenda from the squad.","poster_path":"/9Lo754tWHiVdicHbdmLSrQMwLrZ.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":8.3},{"air_date":"2006-06-12","episode_count":15,"id":3886,"name":"Season 2","overview":"Brenda is now firmly established as leader of Priority Homicide, with her team firmly behind her.

As Brenda investigates, she is drawn into the world of celebrity beauty, where illusion is everything, and the standard high. When she undergoes a make-over to meet the Dean’s discarded lovers one-by-one, each of whom appears to have a motive to murder, Brenda realizes there may be more to this case than a man trying to get out of a marriage. At the same time, she is slowly seduced by the superficial glamour, which seems to impress her colleagues, and Fritz. As the real killer emerges, Brenda comes to the realization that she can only be who she is, and that the rest is just an illusion.","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":1450,"still_path":"/fxilxtzj2hS8ob3TKD9HhR6uR7j.jpg","vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":6,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257051a760ee3776a00b994","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112548,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael M.

As she does, she confronts her own prejudices, and discovers the justice for these women is scarce in a world dominated by men. When the FBI steps in to take over the investigation, she shows the stern stuff she's made of, using highly unorthodox methods to finally bring the murderer to an unusual form of justice. Meanwhile, Brenda's relationship with Fritz takes a new direction, as the FBI's involvement in this case hints at the challenges that will come when they must balance their work and professional lives. At the end of the episode, Brenda purchases one of the dead girl's house, and finds herself the owner of a cat she doesn't want, but who has ideas of its own.","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":1450,"still_path":"/dYOIxH0lCQymbNfSLgHsxJKtPt2.jpg","vote_average":6.9,"vote_count":6,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257051a760ee3776a00ba62","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":154528,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Elodie Keene","original_name":"Elodie Keene","popularity":2.738,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5c2eb87792514165a66e04dd","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1224683,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greer Shephard","original_name":"Greer Shephard","popularity":0.932,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5c2eb85b0e0a2611b8396ae4","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1215373,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Duff","original_name":"James Duff","popularity":2.165,"profile_path":"/wfAdkt7Cm286GcT5qVCKpNWeadb.jpg"},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5c2eb890c3a3682919a63450","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112548,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael M.

Offering assistance is an ex-Army colonel who believes the sniper to be his son. As an all-out gang war looms, Brenda tentatively accepts his assistance, but as her investigation progresses, Brenda's doubts about the Colonel's motives grow. With Fritz' assistance, she realizes the Colonel is not there to help, but to help his son escape. The two face off in the dark on a Los Angeles rooftop, leading to an unexpected outcome. Elsewhere in the story, Sanchez' prior service with the Rampart Division CRASH gang squad allows him to play a pivotal role in the investigation as he briefs the squad on gang activity in the area, goes undercover as a gang member and assists with interrogations. Brenda's tense relationship with Taylor seems to relax, then abruptly grows tenser when a stake-out goes wrong. Gabriel becomes increasingly loyal to her, but Flynn and Provenza continue to resist her methods, dubbing her \"Miss Scarlett.\"","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":1450,"still_path":"/taLRXmP3zYAri0Z5vIgARqNN44K.jpg","vote_average":8.5,"vote_count":4,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257051a760ee3776a00b9f6","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1218786,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wendy West","original_name":"Wendy West","popularity":1.852,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257051a760ee3776a00b994","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112548,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael M.

Nothing is quite as it seems as she investigates the high-powered president of the drug company sponsoring the trial, the seemingly easy-going psychiatrist and the teenaged participants in the study. Too soon, one of the teenagers falls victim to manipulation of the medication, and Brenda untangles a web of exploitation of the young victims leading to an unlikely criminal. Meanwhile, Flynn ratchets up his efforts to undermine Brenda's authority, first by going over her head to Pope, and then, when that fails, by unearthing a groundless ethics investigation Brenda faced in Atlanta. On the personal front, Brenda's relationship with Fritz heats up, much to Provenza's delight!","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":1450,"still_path":"/gzWCVDsxLqfg9PIJEFLyGAOcoCE.jpg","vote_average":8.2,"vote_count":4,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257051f760ee3776a00c3c6","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":154521,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Craig Zisk","original_name":"Craig Zisk","popularity":2.744,"profile_path":"/1WTt2jjxDwT0ngzrpO02VZYZDYV.jpg"},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5c2eb87792514165a66e04dd","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1224683,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Greer Shephard","original_name":"Greer Shephard","popularity":0.932,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5c2eb85b0e0a2611b8396ae4","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1215373,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"James Duff","original_name":"James Duff","popularity":2.165,"profile_path":"/wfAdkt7Cm286GcT5qVCKpNWeadb.jpg"},{"job":"Executive Producer","department":"Production","credit_id":"5c2eb890c3a3682919a63450","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112548,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael M.

But when the perpetrator of the crimes turns out to be something quite different than expected, and has an alibi for the latest murder, Brenda must dig deeper to discover if this crime is part of the string, or a crime of passion disguised as a hate crime. Meanwhile, Flynn and Taylor step up their efforts to undermine Brenda once again, but with unexpected effects, as the team begins to rally around Brenda. Provenza's quirks begin to emerge, and we meet Terrence Hynes, a County Coroner's Forensics Support worker with an odd sense of humor.

At first, a known sex-offender seems the likely candidate, but questions arise about why the girl and her mother were brought to the US, leading the investigation in another direction. Soon, the girl's backpack suggests the girl's uncle or the family for whom the mother worked may have been involved, A search of the house suggests one of the family is the murderer, but which one? An end-run by the family, determined to protect the killer, takes Brenda to Mexico, where she must use all her resources, Fritz and Mexican law to finally bring the killer to justice. The usually cantankerous Dr. Crippen shows his softer side as he briefs Brenda following the autopsy, in a scene representative of the way in which the violent death of a child impacts the police.","production_code":"","runtime":46,"season_number":1,"show_id":1450,"still_path":"/n8FFWIs4XnvbeyelvqD0YqCeiHs.jpg","vote_average":8.7,"vote_count":3,"crew":[{"department":"Writing","job":"Writer","credit_id":"5257051a760ee3776a00b9f6","adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1218786,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Wendy West","original_name":"Wendy West","popularity":1.852,"profile_path":null},{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"5257051a760ee3776a00b994","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":112548,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Michael M.

Brenda has recently joined LAPD after a long career in law enforcement, including with the Atlanta and Washington, D.C., Police Departments. We soon learn Brenda is originally from Atlanta, Georgia, was CIA-trained, and was recruited by her former married lover, Assistant Chief Will Pope. Brenda is resented as an outsider by much of the LAPD and seen as an adversary by Robbery-Homicide's Captain Taylor, who initially persuades her squad to request transfers en masse in an unsuccessful effort to force Brenda's resignation. Brenda soon wins over her assistant, Sgt. David Gabriel, and the grudging admiration of the team when she shows them why she is called a closer; but her battle is far from over. As the season progresses, we see Brenda struggle to establish her authority and earn the respect of her squad, despite the efforts of Taylor and Detective Lt. Andy Flynn to both undermine her authority and hamper her investigations. Slowly, one-by-one, Brenda wins over her team; and, by season's end, she has earned the loyalty of them all, even the hard-boiled Det. Flynn, as they stand united against Capt. Taylor's final attempt to remove Brenda from the squad.","id":3887,"poster_path":"/9Lo754tWHiVdicHbdmLSrQMwLrZ.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":8.3},"2":{"_id":"52570518760ee3776a00b86d","air_date":"2006-06-12","episodes":[{"air_date":"2006-06-12","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":67038,"name":"Blue Blood","overview":"Things don't add up when an LA cop turns up dead.
