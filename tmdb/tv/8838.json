In an attempt at blind rage, he gets his left leg cut off by Isshii (in addition to his right arm in the first episode). Oonishi sees his men at the warehouse and scolds Aida for not coming to him first. He then tells Ichise that he won't kill him because he still has the will to live. After this, Ichise drags himself through the streets with his severed limbs tied to his good leg. He eventually fashions a makeshift crutch, but it doesn't help him that much.\n\nYoshii and the Elder have a little chat. Yoshii says that he didn't come down for any particular reason. The Elder doesn't really know if Yoshii's coming is a good or a bad omen. He has Yoshii take the train to Lux with Ran. On the train, we learn that Ran comes to the city alone often and that she sells flowers at the market there. We also learn from the Elder that she has the ability to see into the near future.","production_code":"","runtime":23,"season_number":1,"show_id":8838,"still_path":"/5LYjiQMxzyfZR1oes3FHmv8DKWO.jpg","vote_average":9,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5a413888c3a36858c502516a","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23994,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chiaki J.

He freaks out, but she knocks him unconscious.\n\nSome men from the Alliance attempt to assassinate Oonishi, but fail miserably.

Basically, is connects to the body's nervous system and transmits its own 'neural information' to the brain (hence why people with Texhnolyze have crazy vision). She also explains that the reason it all works is because of Lafia, which is mined in the Mine. Lafia basically relaxes the body's instinct to reject organs that are alien to the body and allows Texhnolyze to sync with the body.","production_code":"","runtime":23,"season_number":1,"show_id":8838,"still_path":"/FXD2OVhBzOVj8dZpQtnnDMf3DL.jpg","vote_average":8,"vote_count":1,"crew":[{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5a413888c3a36858c502516a","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":23994,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Chiaki J.
