Well, that and a red rubber ball, as we later discover as he seizes his moment during a game of Dodgeball, when he steals the woman of his dreams from possessive Gary Ross. Joel also tells his best friend that the girl who said at her High School 10-year-reunion that she always fancied Pat, was a girl called Stacey and so they pair off also. Isabelle finds her man in Todd York with whom she was last seen in a bitter argument at their Model U.N. Conference. When it comes to the crunch during the main dance, Joel is torn between staying linked with Holly, and persuading his parents, who came along as chaperones, that they should be dancing together rather than his father throwing his marriage into the toilet by insisting that Saturday night is always \"Poker Night\".

Joel chooses his time carefully, opting for scaring the man half to death during his first driving lesson, given that he now has 20 years of driving experience behind him. Bill finally relents, but the disaster that unfolds is \"Chilghetti\", a mix of chili and spaghetti. It's not available in the 21st century, so compared to the other inspirations she's had, this one surely can't be a winner? Meanwhile, Isabelle is set for a disaster of her own as she plans to audition for Scarlett O'Hara in a school production of \"Gone With The Wind\". Joel has knowledge about the audition which, unless it's stopped, will make for a moment that will haunt her until the end of her school days. At the end as the family go ahead and begin to put Chilghetti on the market, they make a toast to an uncertain future.
