Don Adams returned as the voice of Inspector Gadget. It currently airs in reruns in syndication. The series was an educational travelogue program for children, in which the animated Gadget would show viewers the many different sites in famous cities around the world via live-action-clips. The theme song is slightly similar to the one in the Gadget Boy series. In fact, Gadget Boy sometimes makes an appearance in the show.","popularity":1.066,"poster_path":"/x3rFXQx7pK8XsAcfnyYGCkrR4wQ.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1996-01-08","episode_count":16,"id":76182,"name":"The
