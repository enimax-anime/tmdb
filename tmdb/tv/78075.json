Silversmith Brenton West is tasked with reviving a worn-down singing trophy that celebrates the musical talent of a sadly departed mother. Won in 1955, it commemorates a young girl who turned her back on singing when she started a family. Wood expert Will Kirk works wonders on an ornate, wired bird cage gifted to a daughter by the biological father she only managed to track down as an adult. A fiddly fix from Will, along with finishing touches from metal expert Dom, brings the beloved bird cage back to life for Sarah. And leather expert Suzie Fletcher wrestles a beaten-up boxing bag back into shape. It originally belonged to a successful cruiser-weight fighter, and grandson Danny is knocked out by Suzie's stunning transformation.",
