While waiting for the fateful morn, he seeks out a bottle of something special that they request as a last toast. Beckoned to the cottage of a little French boy's family, they are set upon by a German who recounts similar stories of walking away from the front all at the same time on the German side. Rushing back to HQ, Tremaine succeeds in staying the sentence at the last moment, as the officers confirm the veracity of the stories, a mystical event.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":10377,"still_path":"/xq2EDgIPLbjqRkcyPamAuytOrSz.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"department":"Directing","job":"Director","credit_id":"525800bb19c29531db35a77f","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":15766,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"John Newland","original_name":"John Newland","popularity":2,"profile_path":"/14R1MvDdlHlgG4sPaDVJmYzAhOG.jpg"},{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"600f8198d70594003c257f64","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":10911,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lawrence B.
