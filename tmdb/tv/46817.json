As Scott's investigation into the origins of the symbol unfolds, he realizes its use is unique to just two notoriously secret groups--the Knights Templar and their modern day brethren, the Freemasons. Used in secret codes, cryptic ciphers and even the alleged tomb of Jesus himself, the symbol could be the key to understanding two of the biggest mysteries of all time--exactly what the Holy Grail is, and where it's hidden today.",

Because of the archaeoastonomy and solstice illuminations that take place inside of the meticulously planned stone structure, he believes the Knights Templar came to America and built it centuries ago. Now, he's dead set on proving his theory. While planning an elaborate laser light show designed to illustrate the Tower's miraculous features, Scott discovers something else significant that ties this structure--and the Templar's modern day initiates--to one of America's most visited and most treasured icons.",

Could it be more than coincidence that the park shares the same name as the legendary ancestral home of the Aztecs?

As Scott Wolter investigates, he discovers evidence that both sites were constructed using the same type of archaeoastronomy. Not only that, but a number of other animal shapes have been constructed as effigies across the Midwest. In a search for answers, he discovers there could be a connection between all the sites and one of America's biggest pre-Columbian mysteries--what led to the disappearance of the people of Cahokia, America's largest city in pre-Columbian times.",

It's a shocking revelation--but not as shocking as what Scott learns next--that group of Europeans known as the Solutreans may have been here thousands of years before that, and actually predated Clovis people, who have long been thought to have crossed the Bering Strait land bridge and been America's very first settlers. The key to solving the mystery of just how long ago Europeans were here could be a single artifact--a small stone carving of a mammoth discovered by a man near Vero Beach, Florida that dating suggests is 13,000 years old.",

Called to examine a possibly ancient land claim, Scott Wolter is drawn into an epic quest to prove whether French fur traders were actually here on a secret mission to steal pre-Columbian land claims placed at a much earlier time. The key to this whole mystery could lie in tracking down a long-lost artifact, allegedly found with strange carvings that only those with hidden knowledge could understand. On this adventure through America's little-known early history, Scott uncovers a high stakes game of land grabbing where only the winner comes in first--and the only way to win might be to cheat.",

Some think it was an homage to a local Native American chief, but others believe the stone may have had a more sinister use hundred of years earlier. Scott's search for the truth about the Waubansee stone results in a wild romp through important events in the history of Chicago--from ancient to modern times--in which the Waubansee Stone always seems to have played a role.",

But when researchers discover Freemasonic symbols under the 3,500 year old monument, a wrench is thrown into the timeline of History.

Entering into the investigation as a skeptic--which is not a role we often see Scott in--he decides to tackle the question of whether Bigfoot is real. He goes in search of proof, checking out rock paintings of Bigfoot in California and even traveling to Nepal where he meets with a Sherpa who tells him he's seen the Yeti, an Asiatic \"cousin\" of Bigfoot that still roams the Himalayas, with his own eyes. So in the end, will Scott become a believer?",
