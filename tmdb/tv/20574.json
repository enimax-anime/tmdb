This is a landscape full of surprises. Next to peasants ploughing with buffaloes are rivers concealing dwarf alligators and giant salamanders, trained cormorants that catch fish for their masters, bats with unusual tastes and monkeys that hide in caves. But this isn't a nature park. Almost 300 million people live here, with a tradition of eating wildlife. So what forces have shaped this remarkable landscape and how do farmers and wild creatures manage to coexist among the rocks and the rice fields?","production_code":"","runtime":59,"season_number":1,"show_id":20574,"still_path":"/evLSjVXgXGjsuvNHW4UDpNRLxhS.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5af553a3925141510d00215c","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1383912,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"Phil Chapman","original_name":"Phil Chapman","popularity":0.98,"profile_path":"/f1j9z2vnVUTZU5Ir5mUI2RkTJ0D.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2008-05-18","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":586849,"name":"Shangri-La","overview":"Hidden beneath billowing clouds, in China's remote south west, are perhaps the richest natural treasures in all China.

It's also home to some incredible wildlife such as the rare chiru, brown bears, wild yaks and the highest-living predators on Earth. There are more large creatures here than anywhere else in China.

This is a land of warrior tribes, bizarre wildlife and extreme weather, but also of vast and breathtaking evergreen forests, grassy plains and sweeping desert dunes, rich with history. The legendary Silk Road drew traders and their camels across the deserts in search of fabulous wealth, and fierce Mongolian horsemen conquered the known world. Today, nomadic tribesmen still race horses and hunt with golden eagles, while tiny hamsters and Asia's last wild horses struggle to survive in the world's most northerly desert.","production_code":"","runtime":59,"season_number":1,"show_id":20574,"still_path":"/aFwfkImQfp5cqQLd72UytzenM8I.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5af554219251416a77002d50","adult":false,"gender":0,"id":557221,"known_for_department":"Production","name":"George Chan","original_name":"George Chan","popularity":0.861,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2008-06-08","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":586852,"name":"Land of the Panda","overview":"China's heartland with its Han people is the centre of a 5,000-year-old civilization. This land contains the Great Wall, the Temple of Heaven, and Beijing's Olympic Stadium and is home to some of China's most charismatic creatures such as the giant panda, golden snub-nosed monkey, and golden takin.
