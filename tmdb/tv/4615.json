But Hera turned him into stone, condemning Atlas to hold the weight of the world on his shoulders forever.  Hercules and Iolaus took Evander home to Nemesis, while Zeus and Hera began their reconciliation.","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"air_date":"1999-11-27","episode_number":8,"episode_type":"finale","production_code":"","runtime":44,"season_number":6,"show_id":4615,"still_path":"/3l7LMunVPmuzQqbM1g6VZgLIzdM.jpg"},"name":"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys","next_episode_to_air":null,"networks":[{"id":184,"logo_path":null,"name":"Syndication","origin_country":"US"}],"number_of_episodes":111,"number_of_seasons":6,"origin_country":["US"],"original_language":"en","original_name":"Hercules: The Legendary Journeys","overview":"The legendary son of Zeus journeys across the earth fighting monsters and helping people.","popularity":28.581,"poster_path":"/AbmVXsi7Btr6cvppvaHAZflnjTC.jpg","production_companies":[{"id":26727,"logo_path":"/jeTxdjXhzgKZyLr3l9MllkTn3fy.png","name":"Universal Television","origin_country":"US"},{"id":35869,"logo_path":null,"name":"MCA Television","origin_country":""},{"id":7893,"logo_path":null,"name":"Pacific Renaissance Pictures","origin_country":"NZ"},{"id":467,"logo_path":null,"name":"Renaissance Pictures","origin_country":"US"},{"id":16642,"logo_path":null,"name":"USA Network","origin_country":"US"}],"production_countries":[{"iso_3166_1":"US","name":"United States of America"},{"iso_3166_1":"NZ","name":"New Zealand"}],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1994-04-25","episode_count":56,"id":14091,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":null,"season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1995-01-29","episode_count":13,"id":14085,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/oaei0qCs1YKCubzy0ixEi12JIsW.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":9.5},{"air_date":"1995-09-04","episode_count":24,"id":14086,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/pt3Nt3VUKaooMzmNiCxF12hWHSN.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":9},{"air_date":"1996-10-07","episode_count":22,"id":14087,"name":"Season 3","overview":"","poster_path":"/rWKVLyXtx7by5OJ8HZdSJ7Knjs9.jpg","season_number":3,"vote_average":6.5},{"air_date":"1997-10-11","episode_count":22,"id":14088,"name":"Season 4","overview":"","poster_path":"/9XGAu3Jk3nXTAu0rXpH1I9rdwHu.jpg","season_number":4,"vote_average":8.2},{"air_date":"1998-10-03","episode_count":22,"id":14089,"name":"Season 5","overview":"","poster_path":"/dSxMYGzw0A2Th7Dn5iCBVDJzQwG.jpg","season_number":5,"vote_average":10},{"air_date":"1999-10-02","episode_count":8,"id":14090,"name":"Season 6","overview":"","poster_path":"/u03eeUy5fFZSTyDAOiHFGHedq3O.jpg","season_number":6,"vote_average":0}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"},{"english_name":"Slovak","iso_639_1":"sk","name":"Slovenƒçina"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":7,"vote_count":439,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"525776ce760ee36aaa5307f0","air_date":"1995-01-29","episodes":[{"air_date":"1995-01-29","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":334714,"name":"The Wrong Path","overview":"After Hercules and his friend Iolaus stopped a band of hoodlums from robbing an innkeeper, Hercules went home to his family.

The old man insists he doesn't have the money, prompting the satyr to get physical. Hercules stops him, but then the satyr challenges the demigod. Hercules accepts, but instead of a fight he finds he has agreed to a drinking contest. As they drink, the viewer sees that the satyr is continually switching places with his twin brother, meaning he is only drinking half as much as Hercules, but Hercules is unaware of this fact. Eventually, however, the brothers get so drunk that they try to sit down at the same time. Hercules sees this and questions it, but they assure him there is only one of them and he is just drunk. Hercules accepts this, but vows to put them back together and slams them into one another, prompting them to flee as Hercules passes out.\n\nues on his neverending
