In flashback, we see a time in MacLeod's life when he, too, was obsessed with a woman he couldn't have. When Jill is killed in a tragic accident while trying to get way from Keogh, Keogh blames MacLeod and swears vengence.","production_code":"","runtime":48,"season_number":3,"show_id":4414,"still_path":"/ig0otFge058jg6zpY1J0tTRKcYk.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5cda1a930e0a2604afcd18b6","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":185235,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"Lawrence Shore","original_name":"Lawrence Shore","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5cdad8139251416b5bced367","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":82518,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Paul Ziller","original_name":"Paul Ziller","popularity":3.078,"profile_path":"/yt8rTpN2EW9BmmxGyOZbC1ZGMgf.jpg"}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"David Keogh","credit_id":"5cdad878c3a36831dec66421","order":862,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":78685,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Cameron Bancroft","original_name":"Cameron Bancroft","popularity":9.07,"profile_path":"/6NB6mTfuFRmebqyI6srbEIB0iOV.jpg"},{"character":"Jill","credit_id":"5cdad89a9251416b5bced521","order":863,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":74366,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Sorel","original_name":"Nancy Sorel","popularity":5.702,"profile_path":"/sD3BLIPrIxkxkFTpq6CFReVOCnf.jpg"},{"character":"Sarah Carter","credit_id":"5cdad8c79251412f6bd36752","order":864,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":43301,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sherry Miller","original_name":"Sherry Miller","popularity":12.994,"profile_path":"/8loCxWNAAF7m3C3kFAREKqO7mBc.jpg"},{"character":"Mr. Renquist","credit_id":"5cdad8e90e0a26045cce7539","order":865,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":14595,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Duncan Fraser","original_name":"Duncan Fraser","popularity":6.203,"profile_path":"/ckiY9K7fwH5KRuTE3IM5kelwm0c.jpg"},{"character":"Julia Renquist","credit_id":"5cdad91b925141301dd17dbc","order":866,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":25872,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Laura Harris","original_name":"Laura Harris","popularity":19.707,"profile_path":"/f6Rsq2C9k87loUH6ZuM0zWGuIQo.jpg"},{"character":"Henry Carter","credit_id":"5cdada2792514167a7ceee8b","order":867,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":27141,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Kim Kondrashoff","original_name":"Kim Kondrashoff","popularity":3.846,"profile_path":"/uL4rVpEtniiJw0LUuWqKLrGkQWw.jpg"},{"character":"Ginny","credit_id":"5cdada4a0e0a26045cce78f2","order":868,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":1224877,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Nancy Sivak","original_name":"Nancy Sivak","popularity":1.464,"profile_path":"/n0I0yZFsBJVCB0mrSsmNz7d3DCr.jpg"},{"character":"Jake","credit_id":"5cdada7ec3a36875bcc8bc79","order":869,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":80344,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"John R.

Anne tries to convince him to seek medical help, but instead he turns to his old friend Garrick, who has spent centuries studying the mind. MacLeod saw Garrick in the 17th Century, when MacLeod barely escaped being burned as a witch. What MacLeod didn't know was that Garrick was not able to escape as well. Garrick convinces MacLeod that the dark-hooded figure is a racial memory that haunts all Immortals and that the way to defeat it is to not fight it, to accept it for what it is. When MacLeod, haggard and exhausted, faces the specter for the last time, puts down his sword and refuses to fight it, the figure goes for MacLeod's head -- until at the last moment MacLeod realizes the figure is Garrick, seeking his revenge after all these years. In the Tag, Anne, frustrated that MacLeod won't open up to her despite their intimate relationship, leaves him.","production_code":"","runtime":48,"season_number":3,"show_id":4414,"still_path":"/mEw7qfBuPO88OJgnIBW89D9iWGu.jpg","vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[{"job":"Writer","department":"Writing","credit_id":"5cd9ccad9251412f6bd18f3c","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":1851716,"known_for_department":"Writing","name":"David Tynan","original_name":"David Tynan","popularity":0.652,"profile_path":null},{"job":"Director","department":"Directing","credit_id":"5cdad38bc3a36836f6c3ef4d","adult":false,"gender":2,"id":185280,"known_for_department":"Directing","name":"Charles Wilkinson","original_name":"Charles Wilkinson","popularity":1.667,"profile_path":null}],"guest_stars":[{"character":"John Garrick","credit_id":"5cdadb579251417580d32426","order":870,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":46899,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Garwin Sanford","original_name":"Garwin Sanford","popularity":9.188,"profile_path":"/uVhyU0G7LQUHdfRdr2mSmEbzR7B.jpg"},{"character":"Margaret of Devon","credit_id":"5cdadb8e0e0a26407dd06ffd","order":871,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":2312641,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Amy Adamson","original_name":"Amy Adamson","popularity":0.84,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Hag","credit_id":"5cdadbb30e0a26407dd07047","order":872,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":12732,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Margaret Barton","original_name":"Margaret Barton","popularity":1.839,"profile_path":"/mYfJ7d5vgKl5VNZ7T5X0o9QriJ0.jpg"},{"character":"Cop One","credit_id":"5cdadbecc3a3684a97c69d43","order":873,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":185282,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Dorian Joe Clark","original_name":"Dorian Joe Clark","popularity":1.045,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Sheriff","credit_id":"5cdadc2092514121dad36cb3","order":874,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":185283,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Jonathan Palis","original_name":"Jonathan Palis","popularity":0.84,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Cory","credit_id":"5cdadc66c3a3684a97c69e12","order":875,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2312656,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Rogers","original_name":"James Rogers","popularity":0.6,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Merchant","credit_id":"5cdadc92925141301dd184ae","order":876,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":2212825,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"James Timmins","original_name":"James Timmins","popularity":1.38,"profile_path":null},{"character":"Official","credit_id":"5cdadcc0c3a3681443c4240c","order":877,"adult":false,"gender":2,"id":61167,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Frank C.
