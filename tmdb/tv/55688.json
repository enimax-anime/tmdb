It’s crazy!”  Imogen, Holiday Rep    The Magaluf Weekender is a unique new six-part documentary series following goings-on at the infamous holiday resort of Magaluf in Mallorca. Each week we will follow two different groups of 18-24 year-olds as they head out to the resort to party away a long weekend of their lives.    For some, it is their first holiday without their parents, as they check-in to the Lively hotel with their friends for three days they will never forget. Mainly thanks to the fixed rig cameras throughout the hotel filming their every move.",

The girls are an instant hit with the one of the reps, ladies man Jordan. “I don’t know what to say”, says Jordan, “You know that’s every boys fantasy? Two, fit twins!”    After meeting them at the pool, hapless Harry and Tom immediately fall hook, line and sinker for the girls too. They then make a plan for the evening. Sean says, “Best thing to do is to go clubbing tonight with them. First club, if not one of us ‘tashes on to them we’ll just ditch them and go onto the next club.",

The girls have never ventured abroad before without their parents and are determined to enjoy their independence.  As the girls get ready for a night on the town, Christie admits she can’t resist getting bronzed up: “I would say I’m a tanoholic. I’m obsessed with spray tan. I’ve got my own spray tan booth at home because my Dad bought it for me for Christmas.” Not to be outdone by the girls grooming, Gianni sprays his eyebrows with hairspray before heading out on the pull.",
