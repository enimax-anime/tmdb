Johnny and Rose agree to get together. Peter says goodbye to them with a pained look on his face, now uncertain as to whether Duvinder Singh was guilty or innocent.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":1,"show_id":12284,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]}],"name":"Season 1","overview":"","id":23034,"poster_path":null,"season_number":1,"vote_average":0},"2":{"_id":"52581eba760ee36aaa782865","air_date":"2011-11-07","episodes":[{"air_date":"2011-11-07","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":477490,"name":"Episode 1","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":12284,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"5773205e92514159d2000ec1","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meera Syal","original_name":"Meera Syal","popularity":5.796,"profile_path":"/xjndtTD7lIvuCSMtAYBQtTVwMGV.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2011-11-08","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":477492,"name":"Episode 2","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":12284,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"5773209a92514153f400112b","order":501,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":62961,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Sarah Hadland","original_name":"Sarah Hadland","popularity":4.127,"profile_path":"/aVEhNxCplkThxE2flILB3YOoVPp.jpg"}]},{"air_date":"2011-11-09","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":477491,"name":"Episode 3","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":12284,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-11-10","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":477493,"name":"Episode 4","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":12284,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2011-11-11","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"finale","id":477494,"name":"Episode 5","overview":"","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":2,"show_id":12284,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[{"character":"","credit_id":"5773205e92514159d2000ec1","order":500,"adult":false,"gender":1,"id":6975,"known_for_department":"Acting","name":"Meera Syal","original_name":"Meera Syal","popularity":5.796,"profile_path":"/xjndtTD7lIvuCSMtAYBQtTVwMGV.jpg"}]}],"name":"Season 2","overview":"","id":23035,"poster_path":null,"season_number":2,"vote_average":0}}}
