But for those adopted, their origins are complicated as the where they were born fuses with the world in which they’re raised. Danny Bowien was born in Korea but only spent the first 3 months of his infant life there. He was adopted and raised by American parents in Oklahoma — religious, hard-working folks – and instead of a life in Seoul, Danny grows up in suburban middle-America. Adapting to this life was easy, for it was all he knew, but he constantly carried traces of his past with him, superficially and also buried deep below.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":6,"show_id":63397,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2017-11-13","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":2279179,"name":"Threshold","overview":"Danny spends the bulk of his time obsessing over the future – there is urgency in him that needs to be on top of everything, ahead of every trend, aware of what lies beyond the curve. But it would be impossible to know where he’s going without first examining where he came from, and from where that drive was borne. Once he committed to leaving Oklahoma, Danny emerged in San Francisco as a human tabula rasa, open to all of the experiences the city laid before him. It was here that Danny formed who he was as a person and as a chef, and the grassroots movement of Mission Street Food blossomed into what is now his greatest success.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":6,"show_id":63397,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2017-11-13","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":2279180,"name":"Mentor","overview":"Danny has been to China several times, but he’s visited Chengdu (the geographical and spiritual capital of Szechuan food) only once. He’s returning here to reconnect with the place, the food and the person – renowned chef Yu Bo – that have influenced him the most. Szechuan food has been the greatest source of inspiration for Danny, and consequently his life. This episode is about the dishes, cooking methods, unique flavors and stories (both his and Yu Bo’s) that have driven Danny on a quest to master this style of food.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":6,"show_id":63397,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2017-11-20","episode_number":4,"episode_type":"standard","id":2279181,"name":"Family","overview":"For better or worse, we do not get to choose the family into which we’re born. In Danny’s case, nor did he get to choose the family that adopted him. He had no say in where he would live or how he’d be raised. After his mother’s death he felt a bizarre combination of liberation mixed with guilt, and he desperately wanted to hold on to – or recreate – the familial feel of togetherness.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":6,"show_id":63397,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2017-11-27","episode_number":5,"episode_type":"standard","id":2279182,"name":"Risk","overview":"Without risk, there would not be the valuable by-products of risk – success and failure.

Now more than ever, he has gained confidence in taking these risks, and grown more comfortable with both of its outcomes.","production_code":"","runtime":30,"season_number":6,"show_id":63397,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2017-12-04","episode_number":6,"episode_type":"standard","id":2279183,"name":"Unexpected","overview":"Danny Bowien does not cook authentic Chinese cuisine, but he cooks genuine Danny Bowien cuisine – food that is inspired by his love of Szechuan food and New York City and his family and new experiences.

Danny really believes that if you can make it in this ultra-competitive town with its even more competitive dining scene, then there’s nowhere you can’t succeed.

Danny’s Origin story informs much of his playful and constantly evolving cuisine: Born in Korea, adopted & raised by a devoutly Christian white family in Oklahoma. After his mother passed away when he was in his late teens, Danny's perspective shifted and he decided to head to San Francisco for culinary school.  His twenties, like most people's, were a series of highs and lows - culinary school, stints at fine dining restaurants in NY and SF, abusive chefs, falling in love and reconnecting with his Korean roots, and stumbling into what became a food movement, the original Mission Chinese Food in San Francisco.","id":151491,"poster_path":"/eiplFI1JfFqUDfi1S5w5IwxMjlE.jpg","season_number":6,"vote_average":0}}}
