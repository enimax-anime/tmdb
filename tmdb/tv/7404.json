One of them is the mole, a saboteur that could thwart their efforts at anytime. The games began immediately with a challenge that required each of the players to dive waterfall and grab for money -- with the exception of a single player who was left to determine which should jump for real money, and which for fake. When only a small portion of the available money is put in the pot, suspicions immediately flare as to who could be the mole. That evening, some contestants are less than satisfied with their sleeping arrangements when a set of players is told they must sleep outside. One player thwarts the rules by staying awake all night. Later, the teams are sent to a beach to participate in a scavenger-hunt style game. Though they fare somewhat better, winning a majority of the available money, evidence of possible sabotage leads some to wonder if the mole is already at work. The players nervously face the evening's first execution after airing a series of ten challenging questions regarding whom they believe to the be the mole. One player, who seemed to have been given an early advantage, is eliminated in a surprising execution.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":5,"show_id":7404,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2008-06-09","episode_number":2,"episode_type":"standard","id":387211,"name":"The Mole 3.0, Episode 2","overview":"The remaining contestants try their best to compete and gather information, but must remain ever-watchful for signs of possible sabotage from the one mole amongst them.","production_code":"","runtime":null,"season_number":5,"show_id":7404,"still_path":null,"vote_average":0,"vote_count":0,"crew":[],"guest_stars":[]},{"air_date":"2008-06-16","episode_number":3,"episode_type":"standard","id":387216,"name":"The Mole 3.0, Episode 3","overview":"With tension growing amongst the remaining contestants, they are asked to put what little faith they have in each other to the test in a challenge that pairs them into \"Can't Trust\" and \"Trust Blindly\" groups. Members from both of the groups pair up for a harrowing luge ride that also serves as a test of memory. A rules violation on the part of several contestants leads to a major penalty. Later, Jon Kelley sends the contestants on a spy day complete with luxurious massages. Though pleased at the opportunity to relax, the contestants are weary of an upcoming catch, and rightly so. They find that their clothes have been sent off for dry cleaning and are challenged to find suitable clothes within a short time-frame in order to join host Jon Kelley in time for a fine-dining dinner.

Faced with the prospect of spending the night in the cold, the game forces the players to make a choice as to whether or not anyone can be trusted to make a decision that will benefit the group as the whole, rather than merely looking out for their own interests. The players later travel from Uspallata to Mendoza, described as the \"Napa Valley of Argentina.\" Though all are excited by the change in scenery, two players in particular find themselves at each other's throats during the van ride there. The conflict is broken up only when the decision is made by some players to switch vans. At the new destination, the players are tasked with a strongly physical challenge containing a huge twist.

Despite a strong performance in the challenge, certain activities by some players lead others to wonder if any sort of potential sabotage may have been attempted. The players later head to a bridge over the Mendoza River where they are told not only to bungee jump but also to attempt to hit a target. As an added twist, before jumping, each contestant is asked to guess how much money the group will make during the challenge.
