young man who hopes to become the greatest adventurer in the land. After a chance encounter with the lonely goddess, Hestia, his dreams become a little closer to reality. With her support, Bell embarks on a fantastic quest as he ventures deep within the city's monster-filled catacombs, known only as the \"Dungeon.\" Death lurks around every corner in the cavernous depths of this terrifying labyrinth, and a mysterious power moves amidst the shadows.\n\nEven on the surface, survival is a hard-earned privilege. Indeed, nothing is ever certain in a world where gods and humans live and work together, especially when they often struggle to get along. One thing is for sure, though: a myriad of blunders, triumphs and friendships awaits the dauntlessly optimistic protagonist of this herculean tale.","id":66993,"poster_path":"/uiEpRfa2NmgvZD7P0COJ8TeH0G5.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":8},"2":{"_id":"5d06807cc3a3684adb2ba1ef","air_date":"2019-07-12","episodes":[{"air_date":"2019-07-13","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":1821989,"name":"(Party) Banquet of the Gods","overview":"Bell's back with a new adventure!
