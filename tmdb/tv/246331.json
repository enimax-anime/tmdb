In addition to medical treatment, she is a hot shot who has never slept more than three hours a day due to tight schedules such as broadcasts, book concerts, and fan signing events. However, her perfect life, which seemed to be on a roll forever, starts to fall apart. It all begins with Chae U-ri, the new doctor. He is talented, humorous, and full of justice. Therefore, in the eyes of a doctor who believes understanding and trust of patients are the top priority, Su-ji seems to be a selfish person who only cares about her own success, and they naturally become enemies in the hospital. However, when Su-ji disappears due to various scandals, he starts to understand her pain. What will happen between Su-ji and U-ri, who were at each other's throats from the beginning?",
