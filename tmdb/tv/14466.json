As the patients discuss their aftercare plans on Day 17, Erika breaks up with Stefanos. On Day 18, to illustrate that moderation does not work, Drew introduces the patients to guest speakers Audrey Kishline and Sheryl Maloy. The patients are also tasked to address the legal and financial \"wreckage of their past\", during which Bob accompanies Erika to Stefano's apartment for her things. After Drewbee again leaves the clinic, Drew and Dr. Sharp, believing he has an irreversible mental problem stemming from his prior head injuries, have him transferred to a hospital for a psychiatric hold.",

As the patients discuss their aftercare plans on Day 17, Erika breaks up with Stefanos. On Day 18, to illustrate that moderation does not work, Drew introduces the patients to guest speakers Audrey Kishline and Sheryl Maloy. The patients are also tasked to address the legal and financial \"wreckage of their past\", during which Bob accompanies Erika to Stefano's apartment for her things. After Drewbee again leaves the clinic, Drew and Dr. Sharp, believing he has an irreversible mental problem stemming from his prior head injuries, have him transferred to a hospital for a psychiatric hold.",
