Now Deborah is living at a beach house in Malibu and in the process of selling the rights to her book to a movie producer.  Then the stepmother, Stephanie Carew, appears on the scene threatening to sue for libel. This throws a monkey wrench into the movie but when Stephanie's dead body is found floating in a swimming pool everyone assumes the death is accidental and champagne corks begin popping all-around because the blockbuster movie can proceed.  Hold everything, says the coroner.  His autopsy shows that Stephanie did not die in the swimming pool but in the ocean and that the cause of death was a blow on the head not drowning.

His successful toy company would be left to her ONLY if Alice is married or engaged within a year's time.  Until then, her wheelchair bound Uncle Harry and a board of directors will run the company.  In searching for a husband, Alice has one major problem:  she's coyote ugly and she's the first one to admit it.  An artist begins a flirtation  and after seeing a portrait he's painted of her, Alice begins to think she could find happiness with him.
