    "overview": "RuPaul brought Drag Race into the homes of millions and made the once taboo art form mainstream. This newfound renaissance has inspired a new generation to explore the art of drag and challenge the constructs of gender. While RuPaul’s Drag Race is a competition, Drag Heals is a documentary journey that follows men who have never worn heels or make-up but have always dreamed of letting their inner drag queen out. These men (and aspiring queens!) enter Canada’s first ever Drag class to explore how to create a compelling drag persona based on personal experience. For most, this is akin to a second coming out process. The culmination of the workshops will be a public performance where they will face down their fears of stepping into the limelight. Drag is typically viewed from a distance; Drag Heals gives unparalleled access to the creation of a performance that is more than just your average lip sync.",
