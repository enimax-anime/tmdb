The series was based on the Channel 4 British TV pilot produced by Chrysalis, Max Headroom: 20 Minutes into the Future. The series is often mistaken as an American-produced show due to the setting and its use of an almost entirely US cast along with being broadcast in the USA on the ABC network. Cinemax aired the UK pilot followed by a six-week run of highlights from The Max Headroom Show, a music video show where Headroom appears between music videos. ABC took an interest in the pilot and asked Chrysalis/Lakeside to produce the series for US audiences.\n\nThe show went into production in late 1986 and ran for six episodes in the first season with eight being produced in season two.","popularity":7.316,"poster_path":"/q4OgNjHvbC78dLSTFTKnLkTMxqe.jpg","production_companies":[],"production_countries":[],"seasons":[{"air_date":"1985-04-04","episode_count":12,"id":14101,"name":"Specials","overview":"","poster_path":"/pAEDYWk1jC4c1u5XogdYSD3y5e7.jpg","season_number":0,"vote_average":0},{"air_date":"1987-03-31","episode_count":6,"id":14099,"name":"Season 1","overview":"","poster_path":"/AatQpM1Bq8CpOcoyuE8IULybYg5.jpg","season_number":1,"vote_average":4},{"air_date":"1987-09-18","episode_count":8,"id":14100,"name":"Season 2","overview":"","poster_path":"/pQkaClLzsrGYLkrwHzRcxesNc3P.jpg","season_number":2,"vote_average":2.9}],"spoken_languages":[{"english_name":"English","iso_639_1":"en","name":"English"}],"status":"Ended","tagline":"","type":"Scripted","vote_average":6.76,"vote_count":49,"season_data":{"1":{"_id":"5257770d760ee36aaa5363c9","air_date":"1987-03-31","episodes":[{"air_date":"1987-03-31","episode_number":1,"episode_type":"standard","id":335168,"name":"Blipverts","overview":"In the near future, when TVs can't be shut off and ratings are all that matter, investigative reporter Edison Carter and his computer-generated alter ego Max Headroom battle to keep the \"blank\" generation informed.
